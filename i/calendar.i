/*
 * The Julian calendar comprises a 4 year cycle of 1461 days
 * -- three years of 365 days followed by a year of 366 days.
 * The Gregorian calendar of modern times reduced the number of
 * days in a century from 36525 to 36524 for three centuries out
 * of every four, thus having a cycle of 146097 days every 400
 * years, with a mean year of 365.2425 days.
 *
 * See wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_tropical_year for a discussion of
 * the accuracy of this convention; the rate of change of earth's
 * orbital parameters and the gradual lengthening of the day
 * invalidate the concept of any calendric periodicity at about
 * this level.  (The mean tropical year is currently 365.2422 days
 * while the time between vernal equinoxes is 365.2424 days, for
 * example.)
 *
 * The wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar article describes the
 * history of the Western calendar.  In summary:
 * The final day of the Julian calendar was 1582 Oct 4, which was
 * followed by 1582 Oct 15, by papal decree.  The Julian calendar,
 * however, was used in many non-Catholic countries long after this
 * date (and even in some Catholic countries until 1587).  In particular,
 * 1752 Sep 2 was followed by 1752 Sep 14 in the British Empire.  Russia
 * did not switch until 1918.  To confuse dates prior to about 1750 even
 * further, the date on which the year number changed varied; 25 Dec,
 * 25 Mar, and Easter were all popular choices.
 *
 * Months in our calendar, like weeks, have become totally arbitrary
 * divisions.  While you will easily find the 146097 and 1461 day
 * cycles in the following algorithms, the 153 day "cycle" associated
 * with the months has no physical basis or meaning at all; it is
 * merely taking advantage of a lucky accident of the pattern of
 * the number of days in the month.  To explain this, notice first
 * that the natural place to begin the year, from a purely computational
 * point of view, is 1 March, because it is most convenient to put
 * February, the only month with a variable number of days, last, so
 * that as the number of days in a year oscillates between 365 and 366,
 * the number of days in the final month can simply oscillate.  With
 * that ordering of the months, their lengths are:
 *   Mar Apr May Jun Jul   Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec   Jan Feb
 *   31  30  31  30  31    31  30  31  30  31    31 (28 or 29)
 * A very convenient way to describe this is as the first 2.4 cycles
 * of a 5 month pattern 31-30-31-30-31 of 153 days.  (There are many
 * other ways to generate this same pattern; this one happens to be
 * relatively easy to explain or excuse.  If the pattern had been only
 * slightly more irregular, no simple formula would have existed.)

func calendar(&y, &m, &d, n, julian=, noabbrev=)

 *   month M (1=Jan, 2=Feb, ..., 12=Dec) and day of month D in the
 *   first form.  In the second form, JDN is the input, and Y, M,
 *   and D are outputs.
 *
 *   The Julian Day Number is a day count used by astronomers, which
 *   is by definition independent of any calendar; each passing day
 *   increments the count by one.  The zero day of the count falls a
 *   bit before 4700 BC, for esoteric reasons (see Wikipedia).
 *
 *   Julian Day Number modulo 7 (JDN%7) is the day of the week, with
 *   0=Mon, 1=Tue, ..., 6=Sun.
 *
 *   By default, Y, M, and D are in the modern Gregorian calendar.
 *   However, with the julian=1 keyword in either form, calendar
 *   treats Y, M, and D as the date in the Julian calendar, used
 *   in Roman Catholic countries before 1582, in the British
 *   empire before 1752, and in Eastern Orthodox countries well
 *   into the twentieth century (again, see Wikipedia).
 *
 *   In the first form (when computing JDN), if Y<50, calendar
 *   assumes 2000+Y, and if 50<=Y<100, calendar assumes 1900+Y,
 *   unless the noabbrev=1 keyword is present, in which case it
 *   assumes you are doing ill-advised archeological work.  In
 *   the second form, the output Y will always include the century.
 *   The julian=1 keyword implies noabbrev=1.
