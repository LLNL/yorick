   Design for a Drat interface which handles opacity/emissivity
   input from several post-processing files.  Key features:

   (1) One file is the "master file", which contains all of the
       zones (rt, zt, ireg from the original calculation), at all
       of the times that were dumped.  This file may or may not
       contain its own gb, ekap, and akap arrays.

   (2) All other files may contain only subsets of the zones or
       times of the master file.  If they contain only a subset of
       the times, the transport calculation will be done only at
       the times which are common to every file.  Any zone may
       get contributions to its opacity and emissivity from zero,
       one, or more of the files.

   (3) Every file (except possibly the master file) contains its own
       gb, ekap, and akap arrays.  Optionally, it may contain a gexist
       array, which is one shorter than gb, and is 0 in any bins which
       do not exist in that file.  The group dimension of ekap and akap
       should be the number of non-zero elements of gexist.  This allows
       calculations with non-contiguous coverage of photon energy.
       Alternatively, codes which have no concept of photon energy bins
       may write a gav array, and omit the gb array.  A suitable gb will
       be inferred, and gexist is meaningless for this case.
       ===>> In no case may gb or gexist (or gav) change either as a
             function of time, or from zone to zone.
       However, the group structures of the various files need not match.
       You can either specify an overall group structure, or have the
       code generate one for you before you perform the transport
       calculation; in either case, the code will interpolate from
       the group structure in each file onto the common group structure
       where the transport calculation is performed.

   (4) Zones are determined by a separate list of "master" zone indices
       for each slave file (and optionally for the master file, too).
       If a zone in some slave file is marked in its zone list, that
       file will contribute both opacity and emissivity to the total
       for that zone, otherwise it will not contribute.

   (5) The quantities currently dumped, akap (1/length) and
       ekap (power/photon energy/solid angle/area) may not be appropriate
       for another opacity code, because the ekaps from several sources
       cannot simply be added.  Therefore, the slave files may optionally
       dump the variable emiss (power/photon energy/solid angle/volume)
       instead of ekap.  The emiss and akap from several different files
       simply add.

   (6) Some codes may need to dump the opacity arrays with the
       frequency as the first index. The freqfirst flag handles this.

/*= SECTION() multiple mesh support for drat package ======================*/

func multio(filename, opac=, emiss=, srcf=, oscale=, escale=,
            gb=, gav=, gexist=, gscale=, zonelist=, zoneuse=,
            tscale=, noextrap=, freqfirst=)
/* DOCUMENT mf= multio(filename)
         or mf= multio(file)
     opens file FILENAME for use with the multi_streak function.
     The file MUST be subsequently closed using multic, since
     this function produces a hidden reference to the file.  The function
     multif can be used to return an ordinary file pointer, given the
     returned MF structure.  If the argument is already a stream FILE,
     that file will be used.  The call still produces a hidden copy of
     FILE, so you may set your copy of the FILE variable to [], but do
     not close the file.

     The following keywords can be used to allow for variations in the
     variable names or units, and to specify the correspondence between
     the zones in this file, and the zones in the master file:

     zonelist=index_list
     -or- zonelist=zonelist_name
       is an index list into the (rt,zt) mesh arrays of the master file.
       If ireg is the region number array (having the same dimensions as
       rt or zt, and with its first row and column all 0), and if FILENAME
       contains opacity data only for zones with region numbers 1 and 2,
       you could open the file using:
          mf= multio(filename, zonelist=where(ireg==1 | ireg==2))
       The zonelist should be nil only if the spatial dimensions of the
       opacity and emissivity in this file exactly match those of rt or
       zt in the master file.
       If zonelist is a string, it replaces the default name for the
       zonelist variable stored in the file (see multi_zonelist).

     zoneuse=index_list
       The zonelist specifies how the zones in this file correspond
       with those in the master file.  The zoneuse list allows you
       to specify that only some of the zones actually present in the
       opacity and emissivity arrays of this file are to contribute
       to the total.  This might be necessary to avoid double counting
       in a region covered by more than one file.  Hence zoneuse is
       a list of indices into the spatial dimension(s) of the opacity
       and emissivity arrays in this file.  If nil, all zones in this
       file will contribute.  If present, and if zonelist is supplied
       as an array (rather than out of the file), zonelist should
       have the same length as zoneuse.
       As a special case, if zoneuse is a scalar 0, no opacity or
       emissivity will come from this file; this makes sense only if
       this is the master file.

     opac=oname, emiss=ename, srcf=sname
       specify non-default names for the opacity, emissivity, and
       osource function arrays.  The defaults are given by the global
       variables mutli_opac, multi_emiss, and multi_srcf (see help).
       If the emissivity array is present in the file, it is preferred
       to the source function array, which will then be ignored.

     oscale=opacity_unit, escale=emissivity_unit
       are optional conversion factors to bring the units of the
       opac and emiss (or srcf) arrays into agreement among the various
       files which are to be used in a single run.  The default value
       is 1.0 (i.e.- all files are expected to have the same units).

     gb=gbname, gav=gavname, gexist=gexistname
     -or- gexist=group_existence_map
       specify non-default names for the group boundary, group energy,
       and group existence arrays.  The defaults are given by the global
       variables mutli_gb, multi_gav, and multi_gexist (see help).
       If the group boundary array is present in the file, it is preferred
       to the group energy array, which will then be ignored.  The file
       should specify group boundaries if its opacity and emissivity are
       averaged over finite width bins; group energies if its opacity
       and emissivity are computed at points.  The group existence map,
       if present, allows several disjoint spectral regions to exist in
       a single file.  If the data type of gexist is not "string", it
       should be an array of length one less than gb, if gb is present,
       or gav, otherwise.  By this means you can ignore spectral regions
       which are present in the file.

     gscale=photon_energy_unit
       is an optional conversion factor to bring the units of the
       gb (or gav) arrays into agreement among the various files
       which are to be used in a single run.  The default value
       is 1.0 (i.e.- all files are expected to have the same units).

     tscale=time_unit
       is an optional conversion factor to bring the units of the
       time into agreement among the various files which are to be used
       in a single run.  The default value is 1.0 (i.e.- all files are
       expected to have the same units).

     noextrap=1
       if present and non-zero prevents the opacity and emissivity
       data from this file from being extrapolated as 1/hnu^3 in
       master bins at energies above the highest energy bin in this
       file.

     freqfirst=0
       if present and non-zero means the frequency index is first
       for the opacity and emissivity arrays, instead of the
       default of frequency index last.

     like the streak function, but allows opacity to be built up from

     parameter is an array of MultiFiles, each created by multif.
     The master file MF(1) contains the mesh, and the master list of dump
     times.  Only dump times which are present in this master list, and
     in every slave file, will be processed.
     The master file MF(1) need not contain any opacity or emissivity data
     at all; each of the slave files MF(2:0) must contain data for at
     least one zone.

     The emissivities and opacities from each file are interpolated onto
     a common group structure.  This common group structure can be
     provided via the GB keyword to multi_streak.  If it is not provided,
     GB is computed by examining the group boundary (or center) arrays
     from the master and every slave file, and building a group structure
     which is at least as fine as every component group structure, at every
     point in the spectrum.

     Example:
       File family "prob_p00" contains the mesh and opacities and
       emissivities for all zones.  Family "pp_h00" contains post
       processed opacities and emissivities on a much finer spectral
       mesh, but only for zones in regions 1 and 2 of the original
       problem.  You want to transport the emission from the
       inner regions 1 and 2 through the overlying material:

     like the streak function, but allows opacity to be built up from
     "slave files", in addition to the "master file" MF(1) and
     saves the streak in a PDB history file.  The MF parameter
     is an array of MultiFiles, each created by multif.
     The master file MF(1) contains the mesh, and the master list of dump
     times.  Only dump times which are present in this master list, and
     in every slave file, will be processed.
     The master file MF(1) need not contain any opacity or emissivity data
     at all; each of the slave files MF(2:0) must contain data for at
     least one zone.

     If the first argument is OUTFILE, a file variable instead of a
     file name, then that file is used for output.  You can create
     OUTFILE and add static variables to it with save (but do NOT call
     add_record) which streak_save otherwise wouldn't know about.

     The output file has history records at the same times as the
     input file.  Each record contains "time" (a double scalar),
     and the two arrays "transp", the transparency (between 0 and 1),
     and "selfem", the self emission (which has the same units as
     ekap in the file F).  The dimensions of transp and selfem
     are ngroup-by-2-by-nrays (where nrays represents zero or more
     dimensions, copied from the RAYS input array).  The RAYS and
     SLIMITS inputs are placed into the output file as non-record
     variables, and any variables in the drat_static option are
     copied form F to the output file.  The gb and gav variables
     are copied from F into the output file as well.  If the drat_glist
     option is present, that is stored in the output file also.

     The emissivities and opacities from each file are interpolated onto
     a common group structure.  This common group structure can be
     provided via the GB keyword to multi_streak.  If it is not provided,
     GB is computed by examining the group boundary (or center) arrays
