# skeleton configure script for MPY (Message Passing Yorick)
# assumes top level configuration of distribution yorick already done
#
# You need to do the work here yourself:
#
#     MPI implementations typically come with a substitute for the
#     cc and f77 compilers.  These invoke the underlying cc and f77
#     compilers with the appropriate -I, -L, and -l options so the
#     MPI headers and libraries can be found.  If your MPI does not
#     come with these substitutes, you will need to write scripts
#     to do it yourself.  The mpicc-sh script in this directory
#     is an example for the LAM implementation of MPI (LAM's hcc
#     script supplies the necessary -I options, but not the -L or
#     -l options).
#     You don't need to set MPI_F77 correctly unless you plan to use
#     Fortran in your own codes; MPY itself doesn't use any.  Be sure
#     that you've set up the FC line in ../Yorick/Maketmpl correctly
#     if you do care about MPI_F77.
#     MPI_CFLAGS is for any additional CFLAGS (-D or -I options)
#     required to build mpy.c

# Now type this:
#     ./configure mpi-cc-command
# or, if the command is mpicc, simply
#     ./configure
# If mpicc requires compiler flags beyond those in Make.cfg Y_CFLAGS:
#     env 'MPI_CFLAGS=-additional -c-flags' ./configure mpi-cc-command
# Similarly, if you wish to set an mpi Fortran compiler, set the
# MPI_F77 environment variable while running ./configure

# The ./configure script will build Makempy.  Type:
#     make
# to build MPY itself.  See the README for more details.
