;;; Commentary:

;; This module is partly based on yorick-mode.el by Eric Thiebaut
;; and inf-yorick.el by Juan Jose Garcia-Ripoll.  It hopefully supplies
;; all the features of both those packages, and more.

;; INSTRUCTIONS

;; 0. Install yorick, so that typing "yorick" in a shell starts it.
;;    See ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/Yorick/.

;; 1. Load this file, yorick.el, into emacs.

;;    You can do this by placing the following line in your ~/.emacs:
;;      (load "/full/path/to/yorick.el" nil t)
;;    where you fill in /full/path/to appropriately.

;;    Alternatively, if you administer your system and want to make
;;    yorick.el available on a site-wide basis, then put yorick.el in
;;    your site-lisp directory, and put the following in site-start.el:
;;      (autoload 'yorick "yorick" "see yorick.el" t)
;;      (autoload 'yorick-mode "yorick" "see yorick.el" t)
;;      (autoload 'ysh "yorick" "see yorick.el" t)
;;      (autoload 'yssh "yorick" "see yorick.el" t)
;;      (autoload 'yutil-setup "yorick" "see yorick.el" nil)
;;      (if (assoc "\\.i$" auto-mode-alist)
;;          (setcdr (assoc "\\.i$" auto-mode-alist) 'yorick-mode)
;;        (setq auto-mode-alist (append '(("\\.i$" . yorick-mode))
;;              auto-mode-alist)))
;;    The modification to auto-mode-alist overrides the default,
;;    which is to edit *.i files in C-mode.  Very few people even know
;;    what a ".i" C-file is for; however, you may not want to make this
;;    change.  When yorick.el is loaded, the change will be made
;;    anyway, but you may prefer users to be mad at me rather than you.

;; 3. Also in your ~/.emacs (after loading yorick.el if you need to)
;;    you may wish to invoke yutil-setup, which can change the look and
;;    feel of emacs substantially.  If you are already completely
;;    satisfied and comfortable with emacs, just skip this step.

;;    If you have no experience with emacs, and want its mouse and
;;    scrollbar bindings to have a look-and-feel similar to typical
;;    word processing programs (e.g.- MS Word), put this in ~/.emacs:
;;      (yutil-setup t t t t t)

;;    If you want to try my own favorite setup, do this:
;;      (yutil-setup 1 1)
;;    This removes the scrollbars and puts a "windowshade" scrolling
;;    function on the left mouse button to compensate.

;;    See the features section below for details.

;; 4. The command M-x yorick RET launches a yorick process in a comint-mode
;;    buffer called *yoterm*.

;; 5. Opening a yorick .i source file puts that buffer in yorick-mode.
;;    An easy way to do that is to type help RET in the *yoterm* buffer,
;;    then ESC ? to pop to the LINE/FILE.

;; FEATURES

;; 1. yorick-mode: A derivative of c-mode allows you to send
;;    statements, regions, functions, or the whole file to the
;;    yorick process running in the *yoterm* yoterm-mode buffer.

;; Default yorick-mode key bindings that differ from c-mode:
;; Key          Function         Comments

;; RET     newline-and-indent    RET automatically indents next line
;; C-j     newline               C-j to avoid indentation
;; C-x C-e yorick-eval-statement run statement at point in *yoterm*
;; ESC C-x yorick-eval-func      define function at point in *yoterm*
;; C-c C-s yorick-include-file   save then include in *yoterm*
;; C-c i   yorick-show-info      run info command on symbol at point
;; C-c d   yorick-show-help      run help command on symbol at point

;; Assorted useful c-mode bindings:

;; ESC C-f forward-sexp          goto matching ) } or ]
;; ESC C-b backward-sexp         goto matching ( { or [
;; ESC C-a beginning-of-defun    goto beginning of current function
;; ESC C-e end-of-defun          goto end of current function
;; TAB     c-indent-command      indent current line properly
;; ESC C-q c-indent-exp          with point on { indent all lines to }

;; 2. yoterm-mode: a derivative of comint-mode for yorick processes
;;    You ordinarily enter yoterm mode by typing
;;      M-x yorick RET

;; Default yorick-mode key bindings that differ from c-mode:
;; Key          Function         Comments

;; RET     yoterm-send-input
;;   on final line: sends command line to yorick for execution
;;   elsewhere: copies line (minus prompt) to final line
;;              second RET resends it, or you can edit
;; up      yoterm-match-backward
;; down    yoterm-match-forward
;;   anywhere but at end-of-buffer, arrow keys operate as usual
;;   at end-of-buffer:
;;   up arrow recalls previous command line
;;   down arrow recalls next command line
;;     down before any up recalls next line after the last one
;;     recalled, so that RET down RET down RET down etc. will
;;     recall an entire sequence of previous lines (you can edit
;;     any or all in the sequence before hitting RET)
;;   if you begin to type a line, then hit either up or down,
;;   it recalls only lines which match what you have typed so far

;; C-u     yoterm-kill-line-backward  kill line back to prompt
;; C-k     kill-line             kill line forward to end of line
;; C-a     yoterm-bol            goto beginning of line or prompt
;; C-o     comint-kill-output    erase most recent yorick output
;; C-c     yoterm-interrupt      send SIGINT signal to yorick

;; C-.     yofile-pop            open/position the file mentioned in
;;                                 the previous error or help message
;; ESC ?   yofile-pop            (same as C-.)
;; C-,     yoterm-toggle-history show/hide the history buffer
;; C-n     yoterm-toggle-history (same as C-,)
;; TAB     comint-dynamic-complete-filename
;;                               complete filename before point

;; 3. yohist-mode: Every yoterm-mode buffer keeps a record of all
;;    previous input lines in an explicit buffer.  You can recall and
;;    send old lines directly from that history buffer; lines recalled
;;    in this manner become the most-recently-recalled line for the
;;    purposes of the up/down recall mechanism in the yoterm-mode buffer.

;; Default yorick-mode key bindings that differ from c-mode:
;; Key          Function         Comments

;; C-,     yoterm-toggle-history show/hide the history buffer
;; C-n     yoterm-toggle-history (same as C-,)
;; RET     yoterm-hist-input
;;   if you are typing a command line at end-of-buffer RET sends it
;;     (thus you can control yorick from the history buffer)
;;   elsewhere, copy the line containing point to the *yoterm* buffer
;;     and mark it as the one previously recalled for up/down there
;;     a second RET sends the line and advances point to the end of
;;     the next line; a third RET both copies and sends that line,
;;     advancing to the next, and so on

;; 4. M-x ysh RET
;;      starts your UNIX shell (csh, ksh, bash, etc) in a yoterm-mode
;;      buffer.  This is an alternative to shell-mode.
;;    M-x yssh RET
;;      prompts you for a host to connect to using ssh.  The remote
;;      session takes place in a yoterm-mode bufffer.

;; 5. yutil-setup
;;    You can put a call to yutil-setup in your ~/.emacs to alter the
;;    look-and-feel of emacs.  The general form is
;;      (yutil-setup buttons scrollbars mouse-mini mouse-qr hilite)
;;    but you can drop out arguments from right to left to get the
;;    default values.  You can also type this line followed by C-j
;;    in the *scratch* buffer to change settings without exiting emacs.
;;    The possible values of the arguments are as follows:

;;      buttons      nil  use default emacs mouse bindings
;;                   t    use PC-like mouse bindings
;;                   1    use enhanced emacs mouse bindings
;;        By default, emacs binds the mouse buttons as follows:
;;          left button:   click to set editing point
;;                         drag to select region
;;                         double click selects words, triple lines
;;          middle button: click to paste where you click
;;          right button:  click sets end of region begun with left click
;;                           second click at same place kills region
;;                         drag extends selection
;;        You can use scroll bar between left and right clicks to select
;;        multipage regions.  The "enhanced" emacs bindings are the same
;;        except for the left button:
;;          left button:   click to set editing point
;;                         drag vertically to scroll window
;;        The "enhancement" makes it possible to dispense with scroll bars.
;;        The PC-like mouse bindings are similar to the default bindings,
;;        but the selection becomes "pending delete" -- that is, if
;;        something is selected, it will be replaced by what you type.
;;        Details are explained in the documentation for the emacs
;;        commands delete-selection-mode, transient-mark-mode, and
;;        the variable highlight-nonselected-windows.

;;      scrollbars   nil  default emacs scroll bar bindings
;;                   t    use PC-like scroll bar bindings
;;                   1    turn off scroll bars
;;        By default, emacs scroll bars work the same as xterm scroll
;;        bars, which is very different from the way scroll bars work
;;        in typical Windows or MacIntosh applications.  Set this to t
;;        to get the following bindings when you click on a scrollbar:
;;          left button:   click above slider to page up
;;                         click below slider to page down
;;                         drag slider to move long distances
;;          middle button: click to move slider to place you clicked
;;                         drag moves slider as with left button
;;          right button:  drag mouse to do windowshade scrolling
;;                         for fine adjustments
;;        If you set buttons to 1, you don't need scrollbars, and you
;;        set scrollbars to 1 as well.

;;      mouse-mini   nil  default emacs behavior
;;                   t    exits minibuffer when you click outside it
;;        By default, if you click outside the minibuffer when it is
;;        active, emacs allows you to continue editing, but keeps the
;;        minibuffer operation active.  This can be useful, but often
;;        confuses novice users.  Emacs novices should set this to t.

;;      mouse-qr     nil  default query-replace
;;                   t    use an (optionally) mouse-driven query-replace
;;        By default, the emacs find-and-replace function can be
;;        puzzling to novice users.  The mouse-driven version is
;;        identical except that during the query, the menu bar shows
;;        buttons so you don't need to know or remember the keystrokes.
;;      ***breaks modern emacsen, disabled***

;;      hilite       nil  syntax hiliting initially off in yorick-mode
;;                   t    syntax hiliting initially on in yorick-mode
;;        Syntax highlighting colorizes different syntactic elements
;;        so comments show in one color, keywords in another, quoted
;;        strings in a third, and so on.  This can take some time in
;;        a large source file, and the attempts to colorize incomplete
;;        lines as you are editing can be annoying.  If you like it
;;        anyway, you should consider putting hilite to nil and
;;        instead putting the line
;;          (global-font-lock-mode 1)
;;        in your ~/.emacs.  This overrides the hilite argument and
;;        turns on syntax hiliting in *every* emacs buffer.

;; BUGS
;;
;; 1. Input events from mouse clicks on the menu bar and menus are
;;    not delivered to the lisp interpreter until the entire sequence
;;    is complete -- that is, until the sequence [menu-bar menu submenu
;;    ... action] corresponds to a function rather than to another
;;    submenu keymap.  When the sequence finishes, compiled code delivers
;;    the sequence of input events menu-bar, menu, submenu, ..., action.
;;
;;    For emacs 19.29 and earlier (but not in 19.34 and later), if
;;    the menu bar button is bound directly to a function [menu-bar action],
;;    no events at all are delivered to the interpreter, as if the
;;    input sequence never finished.  Hence, menu bar buttons (such as
;;    the STOP button in yoterm-mode, and yutil-query-replace, ybrowse-mode,
;;    and ymenu-list-buffers) which cause immediate actions rather than
;;    popping up a menu do not work in those versions of emacs.
;;
;; 2. Numerous features used here (e.g.- kill-buffer-hook, make-local-hook)
;;    do not exist at all in emacs 19.28, so 19.29 is the earliest version
;;    that will work at all.
