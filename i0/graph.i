extern window;
/* DOCUMENT window, n, display="host:server.screen", dpi=100/75, wait=0/1,
                       private=0/1, hcp="hcp_filename", dump=0/1,
                       legends=1/0, style="style_sheet_filename",
                       width=wpixels,height=hpixels,rgb=1,
                       parent=id,xpos=x_in_parent,ypos=y_in_parent,
                       title="Yorick $n"

     select window N as the current graphics output window.  N may
     range from 0 to 63, inclusive.  Each graphics window corresponds to
     an X window, and optionally has its own associated hardcopy file.
     If N is omitted, it defaults to the current coordinate system.

     The X window will appear on your default display at 75 dpi, unless
     you specify the display and/or dpi keywords.  A dpi=100 X window
     is larger than a dpi=75 X window; both represent the same thing
     on paper.  Use display="",hcp="filename" to create a graphics window
     which has no associated X window, but instead plots to a hardcopy
     file (you should do this if you want to make plots in a non-interactive
     batch mode).

     By default, if the X window needs to be created, the graphics area
     will be 450x450 pixels if dpi=75, or 600x600 pixels if dpi=100,
     representing a 6x6 inch square on hardcopy paper.  You can override
     this default initial size using the width and height keywords.
     These settings remain in force indefinitely; use width=0,height=0
     to return to the default dpi-dependent behavior.  For a dpi=75,
     landscape=0 window, width=638,height=825 displays the entire sheet
     of hardcopy paper.  Supplying these keywords will not change the
     size of an existing window; only newly created windows.

     By default, the X xindow title is "Yorick $n" with $n the window
     number.  Keyword title can be used to specify any other name.

     By default, an X window will attempt to use shared colors, which
     permits several Yorick graphics windows (including windows from
     multiple instances of Yorick) to use a common palette.  You can
     force an X window to post its own colormap (set its colormap
     attribute) with the private=1 keyword.  You will most likely have
     to fiddle with your window manager to understand how it handles
     colormap focus if you do this.  Use private=0 to return to shared
     colors.

     By default, Yorick will not wait for the X window to become visible;
     code which creates a new window, then plots a series of frames to
     that window should use wait=1 to assure that all frames are actually
     plotted.

     By default, a graphics window does NOT have a hardcopy file
     of its own -- any request for hardcopy are directed to the
     default hardcopy file, so hardcopy output from any window goes
     to a single file.  By specifying the hcp keyword, however, a
     hardcopy file unique to this window will be created.  If the
     "hcp_filename" ends in ".cgm", the hardcopy file is a binary CGM
     file; otherwise, hardcopy files are in Postscript format.  Use
     hcp="" to revert to the default hardcopy file (closing the window
     specific file, if any).  The legends keyword, if present, controls
     whether the curve legends are (legends=1, the default) or are not
     (legends=0) dumped to the hardcopy file.  The dump keyword, if
     present, controls whether all colors are converted to a gray scale,
     (dump=0), or the current palette is dumped at the beginning of each
     page of hardcopy output (dump=1, the default).  (The legends keyword
     applies to all pictures dumped to hardcopy from this graphics
     window.  The dump keyword applies only to the specific hardcopy
     file defined using the hcp keyword -- use the dump keyword in the
     hcp_file command to get the same effect in the default hardcopy
     file.)

     Use rgb=1 to set the rgb color model when you are creating a
     window on an 8-bit display on which you intend to use three
     component rgb colors (see color).  This installs the 5x9x5
     colorcube and avoids having to issue the palette command
     after the first true color object has been drawn.

     If both display="" and hcp="", the graphics window will be
     entirely eliminated.

     The style keyword, if present, specifies the name of a Gist style
     sheet file; the default is "work.gs".  The style sheet determines
     the number and location of coordinate systems, tick and label styles,
     and the like.  Other choices include "axes.gs", "boxed.gs",
     "work2.gs", and "boxed2.gs".

     The parent=id keyword can be used to make the yorick window a
     subwindow of an existing window.  The id is an integer, which is
     the system-dependent window id that must be retrieved from the
     application which owns the parent window.  When parent= is defined,
     xpos= and ypos= specify the offset in that window; both default to 0.

     If invoked as a function, window(...) returns the current
     window number.

     window with pointer focus, or -1 if none.

     The function has_mouse with a void argument returns true if any
     Yorick graphics window has the pointer focus. If WIN is
     specified, the function has_mouse returns true if graphics window
     WIN has the pointer focus.

/* DOCUMENT no_window

     Set up a graphics window with no interactive display, similar to
       window, display="", hcp=hcpname, dump=1, legends=0;
     You can optionally supply a filename HCPNAME; if you do not, the
     default filename will be "no_window".  If HCPNAME is "" or string(0),
     this graphics window is killed, and the special behavior of the
     eps and other commands (see below) is restored to normal.  Use
     no_window if you do not want to create an interactive graphics
     window, for example when yorick is running in batch mode and is
     not connected to any interactive graphics devices, causing the
     code to crash when it tries to create an interactive window.

     As a convenience, no_window accepts a style= keyword, which it will
     pass along to the window command.  If you need to set other window
     properties, call the window function after no_window.

     Additionally, the no_window function changes the behavior of the
     single picture commands hcps, eps, pdf, png, jpeg (and other functions
     based on the hcps command) to write the current drawing to the specified
     file, then reissue a non-displaying window command.  The effect is to
     simplify making a sequence of plots in batch mode without creating any
     interactive graphics window.  If you want to write the whole sequence
     into a single .ps file, you use the no_window function to set the
     filename, then hcp or hcp_on to dump frames into the file.

     Alternatively, if you need to write one file per frame (for example
     one png per picture to include in slides using presentation software),
     you can call no_window, then issue the png (or similar) command just
     before advancing to the next frame.  (Unfortunately, you cannot do
     both -- either you are writing all the frames into one ps file, or
     you are writing one frame per file.  Calling the single frame function
     will close the postscript file.)

     By default, graphics windows set a window manager hint which

     hint will not be set when a new graphics window is created.
     This causes the window manager to refuse to offer keyboard
     focus to the graphics window -- very desirable, since it can't
     accept keyboard input anyway.  With fvwm, for example, this
     means keyboard focus can stay in the terminal window even when
     you are mouse zooming the graphics window.  However, many
     window managers confuse colormap focus with keyboard focus, so
     if you set the private=1 colormap in the window function, you
     may not be able to convince the window manager to give the
     graphics window colormap focus since it won't give it keyboard
     focus.  Weird.

     You may have problems with hairline artifacts in plf or plfc output.
     This turns out to be caused by anti-aliasing; the files are correct,
     but modern rendering engines create the artifacts by trying to
     soften pixelated edges.  If you can figure out how to turn off
     antialiasing in your rendering software, you can generally get
     rid of the hairlines.  The downside is, that text an diagonal lines
     will have jagged edges and look worse.  What you want is a very
     high resolution display, and turn off anti-aliasing (since it isn't
     so necessary).

     You may have problems with hairline artifacts in plf or plfc output
     (they also show up occasionally in pdf or postscript output).
     This turns out to be caused by anti-aliasing (for pdf or ps as well);
     the files are correct, but modern rendering engines create the
     artifacts by trying to soften pixelated edges.

     In SVG, the solution is to set the shape-rendering property to
     shape-rendering='crispEdges' or shape-rendering='optimizeSpeed'
     which can be done either globally in the leading <svg> tag, or
     in each group <g> tag ghostscript uses to represent a filled polygon.
     I don't know how to make ghostscript do that for you.  Oddly
     enough, shapeRendering='geometricPrecision" apparently means
     anti-aliasing is turned on; the fuzzy edges causes the hairlines
     you see, since each polygon fuzzes its own edges without paying
     any attention to the adjacent polygon's color.

         or palette, red, green, blue, gray, query=1
     sets (or retrieves with query=1) the palette for the current
     graphics window.

     The cmap function provides a higher level interface, including
     dozens more named palette choices.

     The FILENAME is the name of a Gist palette file; the standard
     palettes are "viridis.gp", "magma.gp", "inferno.gp", "plasma.gp",
     "coolwarm.gp", "earth.gp", "stern.gp", "rainbow.gp", "heat.gp",
     "gray.gp", and "yarg.gp".  Use the maxcolors keyword in the
     pldefault command to put an upper limit on the number of
     colors which will be read from the palette in FILENAME.

     In the second form, the palette for the current window is copied
     from the SOURCE_WINDOW_NUMBER.  If the X colormap for the window is
     private, there will still be two separate X colormaps for the two
     windows, but they will have the same color values.

     In the third form, RED, GREEN, and BLUE are 1-D arrays of the same
     length specifying the palette you wish to install; the values
     should vary between 0 and 255, and your palette should have no
     more than 240 colors.  If ntsc=0, monochrome devices (such as most
     laser printers) will use the average brightness to translate your
     colors into gray; otherwise, the NTSC (television) averaging will
     be used (.30*RED+.59*GREEN+.11*BLUE).  Alternatively, you can specify
     GRAY explicitly.

     Ordinarily, the palette is not dumped to a hardcopy file
     (color hardcopy is still rare and expensive), but you can
     force the palette to dump using the window or hcp_file commands.

     See the dump= keyword for the hcp_file and window commands if you
     are having trouble getting color in your hardcopy files.

     defines mulitple coordinate systems.  You need to do this if
     you want to display four plots side by side on a single page,
     for example.  The standard style sheets "work2.gs" and "boxed2.gs"
     define two overlayed coordinate systems with the first labeled
     to the right of the plot and the second labeled to the left of
     the plot.  When using overlayed coordinate systems, it is your
     responsibility to ensure that the x-axis limits in the two

     plots TEXT (a string) at the point (X,Y).  The exact relationship
     between the point (X,Y) and the TEXT is determined by the
     justify keyword.  TEXT may contain newline ("\n") characters
     to output multiple lines of text with a single call.  The
     coordinates (X,Y) are NDC coordinates (outside of any coordinate
     system) unless the tosys keyword is present and non-zero, in
     which case the TEXT will be placed in the current coordinate
     system.  However, the character height is NEVER affected by the
     scale of the coordinate system to which the text belongs.
     Note that the pledit command takes dx and/or dy keywords to
     adjust the position of existing text elements.

     The characters ^, _, and ! are treated specially in TEXT.
     ^ begins a superscript, _ begins a subscript, and ! causes the
     following character to be rendered using the symbol font.  As
     special cases, !^, !_, and !! render the ^, _, and ! characters
     themselves.  However, if ! is the final character of TEXT
     (or immediately before a newline in multiline text), it
     loses its special meaning.  TEXT has just three modes: ordinary,
     superscript, and subscript.  A ^ character enters superscript
     mode from ordinary or subscript mode, and returns to ordinary
     mode from superscript mode.  A _ enters subscript mode, except
     from subscript mode it returns to ordinary mode.  For example,

extern limits;
/* DOCUMENT limits
         or limits, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax,

         or old_limits= limits()
         or limits, old_limits

     In the first form, restores all four plot limits to extreme values.

     In the second form, sets the plot limits in the current coordinate
     system to XMIN, XMAX, YMIN, YMAX, which may be nil or omitted to
     leave the corresponding limit unchanged, a number to fix the
     corresponding limit to a specified value, or the string "e" to
     make the corresponding limit take on the extreme value of the
     currently displayed data.

     If present, the square keyword determines whether limits marked
     as extreme values will be adjusted to force the x and y scales
     to be equal (square=1) or not (square=0, the default).
     If present, the nice keyword determines whether limits will be
     adjusted to nice values (nice=1) or not (nice=0, the default).
     There is a subtlety in the meaning of "extreme value" when one
     or both of the limits on the OPPOSITE axis have fixed values --
     does the "extreme value" of the data include points which
     will not be plotted because their other coordinate lies outside
     the fixed limit on the opposite axis (restrict=0, the default),
     or not (restrict=1)?

     If called as a function, limits returns an array of 5 doubles;
     OLD_LIMITS(1:4) are the current xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax,
     and int(OLD_LIMITS(5)) is a set of flags indicating extreme
     values and the square, nice, restrict, and log flags.

     In the fourth form, OLD_LIMITS is as returned by a previous
     limits call, to restore the limits to a previous state.

     In an X window, the limits may also be adjusted interactively
     with the mouse.  Drag left to zoom in and pan (click left to zoom
     in on a point without moving it), drag middle to pan, and click
     (and drag) right to zoom out (and pan).  If you click just above
     or below the plot, these operations will be restricted to the
     x-axis; if you click just to the left or right, the operations
     are restricted to the y-axis.  A ctrl-left click, drag, and
     release will expand the box you dragged over to fill the plot
     (other popular software zooms with this paradigm).  If the
     rubber band box is not visible with ctrl-left zooming, try
     ctrl-middle or ctrl-right for alternate XOR masks.  Such
     mouse-set limits are equivalent to a limits command specifying
     all four limits EXCEPT that the unzoom command can revert to
     the limits before a series of mouse zooms and pans.

     Holding the shift key and pressing the left mouse button is
     equivalent to pressing the middle mouse button.  Similarly,
     pressing meta-left is equivalent to the right button.  This
     permits access to the middle and right button functions on
     machines (e.g.- most laptops) with two button or one button
     mice.

     The limits you set using the limits or range functions carry over
     to the next plot -- that is, an fma operation does NOT reset the
     limits to extreme values.

extern gridxy;
/* DOCUMENT gridxy, flag
         or gridxy, xflag, yflag
     Turns on or off grid lines according to FLAG.  In the first form, both
     the x and y axes are affected.  In the second form, XFLAG and YFLAG
     may differ to have different grid options for the two axes.  In either
     case, a FLAG value of 0 means no grid lines (the default), a value of
     1 means grid lines at all major ticks (the level of ticks which get
     grid lines can be set in the style sheet), and a FLAG value of 2 means
     that the coordinate origin only will get a grid line.  In styles with
     multiple coordinate systems, only the current coordinate system is
     affected.
     The keywords can be used to affect the style of the grid lines.

     You can also turn the ticks off entirely.  (You might want to do this
     to plot your own custom set of tick marks when the automatic tick
     generating machinery will never give the ticks you want.  For example
     a latitude axis in degrees might reasonably be labeled "0, 30, 60,
     90", but the automatic machinery considers 3 an "ugly" number - only
     1, 2, and 5 are "pretty" - and cannot make the required scale.  In
     this case, you can turn off the automatic ticks and labels, and use
     plsys, pldj, and plt to generate your own.)
     To fiddle with the tick flags in this general manner, set the
     0x200 bit of FLAG (or XFLAG or YFLAG), and "or-in" the 0x1ff bits
     however you wish.  The meaning of the various flags is described
     in the file Y_SITE/gist/work.gs.  Additionally, you can use the
     0x400 bit to turn on or off the frame drawn around the viewport.
     Here are some examples:
        gridxy,0x233        work.gs default setting
        gridxy,,0x200       like work.gs, but no y-axis ticks or labels
        gridxy,,0x231       like work.gs, but no y-axis ticks on right
        gridxy,0x62b        boxed.gs default setting

     The three keywords base60=, degrees=, and hhmm= can be used to get
     alternative tick intervals for base 60 systems instead of the
     usual base 10 systems.  The keyword values are 0 to restore the
     default behavior, 1 to set the feature for the x axis, 2 to set it
     for the y axis, and 3 to set it for both axes.  The base60 feature
     allows ticks and labels at multiples of 30 (up to +-3600).  The
     degrees feature causes labels to be printed modulo 360 (so that a
     scale which runs from, say, 90 to 270 will be printed as 90 to 180
     then -180 to -90, mostly for longitude scales).  The hhmm feature
     causes labels to be printed in the form hh:mm (so that, for example,
     150 will be printed as 02:30, mostly for time of day scales).

     "grayd", "grayc", "grayb", graya", (grayd darkest, graya lightest)
     or a 0-origin index into the current palette.  The default is "fg".
     Negative numbers may be used instead of the strings: -1 is bg

     -5 is red, -6 is green, -7 is blue, -8 is cyan, -9 is magenta,
     -10 is yellow, -11 is grayd, -12 is grayc, -13 is grayb, and -14 is
     graya.  (The negative numbers are actually taken modulo
     256, so -1 is also 255, -2 is 254, and so on.)

     A color can also be a triple [r, g, b], with values running from
     0 for dark to 255 for full intensity.  Beware, however, of
     specifying an rgb color (either as a color keyword or to the
     plf, pli, or plfp commands) if your display is not a true color
     display (for example, if it is 8 bits deep or less).  In that
     case, it may switch to a 5x9x5 color cube, which causes a
     significant degradation in quality of rendering with smooth
     color palettes.  Furthermore, the hcp command will not work
     properly for rgb colors if the file is a CGM.  Use the rgb=1
     keyword in the window command to avoid having to re-issue a
     palette command after the first rgb object is drawn (this is
     unnecessary on true color screens).

     You can use color=torgb(name) to specify a W3C/X11 color.

     "courier", "times", "helvetica" (the default), "symbol", or

     "courierB" is boldface Courier, "timesI" is Times italic, and
     "helveticaBI" is bold italic (oblique) Helvetica.  Your X server
     should have the Adobe fonts (available free from the MIT X
     distribution tapes) for all these fonts, preferably at both 75
     and 100 dpi.  Occasionally, a PostScript printer will not be
     equipped for some fonts; often New Century Schoolbook is missing.
     The font keyword may also be an integer: 0 is Courier, 4 is Times,
     8 is Helvetica, 12 is Symbol, 16 is New Century Schoolbook, and
     you add 1 to get boldface and/or 2 to get italic (or oblique).

     The height is the font size in points; 14.0 is the default.

     By default, opaque=0 and text is transparent.  Set opaque=1 to
     white-out a box before drawing the text.  The default orient
     (orient=0) is left-to-right text; set orient=1 for text rotated 90
     degrees so it reads upward, orient=2 for 180 degree rotation so
     it is upside down, and orient=3 for 270 degree rotation so it
     reads downward.

     The default text justification, justify="NN" is normal is both
     the horizontal and vertical directions.  Other possibilities
     are "L", "C", or "R" for the first character, meaning left,
     center, and right horizontal justification, and "T", "C", "H",
     "A", or "B", meaning top, capline, half, baseline, and bottom
     vertical justification.  The normal justification "NN" is equivalent
     to "LA".  Common values are "LA", "CA", and "RA" for garden variety
     left, center, and right justified text, with the y coordinate at the
     baseline of the last line in the string presented to plt.  The
     characters labeling the right axis of a plot are "RH", so that the
     y value of the text will match the y value of the corresponding
     tick.  Similarly, the characters labeling the bottom axis of a plot

     You can use the reshape function to peek at the data at the addresses
     returned in PROPERTIES(5) as longs.  The appropriate data types are:
     char for text, int for ireg, short for triangle, char for colors, and
     double for everything else.  In a plf, colors is (imax-1)-by-(jmax-1).
     Although PROPERTIES(5) returns pointers to the data plotted, attempting
     to poke new values into this data will not produce immediate changes
     to your plot, since the graphics package does not realize that anything
     has changed.  Use pledit to make changes to plotted elements.

     The plq function always operates on the current coordinate system
     in the current graphics window; use window and plsys to change these.

     plotted by plc.  Z, Y, X, and IREG are as for plc, and the
     triangle= and region= keywords are accepted and have the same
     meaning as for plc.  Unlike plc, the triangle array is an output
     as well as an input to contour; if supplied it may be modified
     to reflect any triangulations which were performed by contour.

     LEVEL is a scalar z value to return the points at that contour
     level.  All such points lie on edges of the mesh.  If a contour
     curve closes, the final point is the same as the initial point
     (i.e.- that point is included twice in the returned list).

     LEVEL is a pair of z values [z0,z1] to return the points of
     a set of polygons which outline the regions between the two
     contour levels.  These will include points on the mesh boundary
     which lie between the levels, in addition to the edge points
     for both levels.  The polygons are closed, simply connected,
     and will not contain more than about 4000 points (larger polygons
     are split into pieces with a few points repeated where the pieces
     join).

     YC and XC are the output points on the curve(s), or nil if there
     are no points.  On input, they must be simple variable references,
     not expressions.  The return value NC is a list of the lengths of
     the polygons/polylines returned in (XC,YC), or nil if there are
     none.  numberof(XC)==numberof(YC)==sum(NC).  For the level pair
     case, YC, XC, and NC are ready to be used as inputs to plfp.

extern mouse;
/* DOCUMENT result= mouse(system, style, prompt)
     displays a PROMPT, then waits for a mouse button to be pressed,
     then released.  Returns array of eleven doubles:
       result= [x_pressed, y_pressed, x_released, y_released,
                xndc_pressed, yndc_pressed, xndc_released, yndc_released,
                system, button, modifiers]

     If SYSTEM>=0, the first four coordinate values will be relative to
     that coordinate system.
     For SYSTEM<0, the first four coordinate values will be relative to
     the coordinate system under the mouse when the button was pressed.
     The second four coordinates are always normalized device coordinates,
     which start at (0,0) in the lower left corner of the 8.5x11 sheet of
     paper the picture will be printed on, with 0.0013 NDC unit being
     1/72.27 inch (1.0 point).  Look in the style sheet for the location
     of the viewport in NDC coordinates (see the style keyword).

     If STYLE is 0, there will be no visual cues that the mouse
     command has been called; this is intended for a simple click.
     If STYLE is 1, a rubber band box will be drawn; if STYLE is 2,
     a rubber band line will be drawn.  These disappear when the
     button is released.

     Clicking a second button before releasing the first cancels the
     mouse function, which will then return nil.
     Ordinary text input also cancels the mouse function, which again
     returns nil.

     The left button reverses forground for background (by XOR) in
     order to draw the rubber band (if any).  The middle and right
     buttons use other masks, in case the rubber band is not visible
     with the left button.

     long(result(9)) is the coordinate system in which the first four
     coordinates are to be interpreted.
     long(result(10)) is the button which was pressed, 1 for left, 2
     for middle, and 3 for right (4 and 5 are also possible).
     long(result(11)) is a mask representing the modifier keys which
     were pressed during the operation: 1 for shift, 2 for shift lock,
     4 for control, 8 for mod1 (alt or meta), 16 for mod2, 32 for mod3,
     64 for mod4, and 128 for mod5.

     Holding the shift key and pressing the left mouse button is
     equivalent to pressing the middle mouse button.  Similarly,
     pressing meta-left is equivalent to the right button.  This
     permits access to the middle and right button functions on
     machines (e.g.- most laptops) with two button or one button
     mice.  The long(result(10)) value returned by mouse() reflects
     this convention, returning 2 or 3 for those cases, even though
     it is button 1 that is actually being pressed.  Therefore, there
     is no way to distinguish shift-left from shift-middle, because the
     long(result(11)) mask indicates tht the shift button is pressed
     in either case.  (And on a machine without a middle button,
     there would be no way to emulate shift-middle anyway.)

/* DOCUMENT plfc, z, y, x, levs=z_values

     fills contours of Z on the mesh Y versus X.  Y, X, and IREG are
     as for plm.  The Z array must have the same shape as Y and X.
     The function being contoured takes the value Z at each point
     (X,Y) -- that is, the Z array is presumed to be point-centered.

     The LEVS keyword is a list of the values of Z at which you want
     contour curves.  These curves divide the mesh into numberof(LEVS)+1
     regions, each of which is filled with a solid color.  If LEVS is
     nil, up to 19 "nice" equally spaced level values spanning the
     range of Z are selected.  The level values actually used are
     always output to the external variable plfc_levs.

     If you specify levs=, you may also specify colors= a list of
     colors of length numberof(LEVS)+1.  The colors should be indices
     into the current palette.  If you do not specify them, equally
     spaced colors are chosen.

     COLORS is specified, it should have one more value than LEVS,
     otherwise equally spaced colors are chosen, or plfc_colors if
     plfc_levs was used.  With the vert=1 keyword the color bar appears
     to the left of the current coordinate system (vert=0 is default).
     By default, color_bar will attempt to label some of the color
     interfaces.  With the labs= keyword, you can force the labelling
     algorithm as follows: labs=0 supresses all labels, labs=n forces
     a label at every nth interface, labs=[i,n] forces a label at every
     nth interface starting from interface i (0<=i<=numberof(LEVS)).
     You can use the adjust= keyword to move the bar closer to (adjust<0)
     or further from (adjust>0) the viewport, and the height= keyword to
     set the height of any labels (default 14 points).

func pleb(y, x, dx=, dy=, mfill=, color=, width=, marker=, msize=)
/* DOCUMENT pleb, y, x, dx=dx, dy=dy
     plots Y vs. X with error bars.

     Uncertainty on X and/or Y are specified with the dx= and dy= keywords.
     X and Y must have same dimensions, dx= and dy= must be conformable
     with X (or Y).  Either dx or dy may be nil for no error bar in that
     direction.  Scalar dx or dy gives equal error bars at all points,
     dimsof(dx)==dimsof(X), etc., gives different error bar at each point.
     dx= and dy= may also have a trailing dimension of length 2 in order
     to get asymmetric error bars; dx(..,1) is the lower error bar length,
     and dx(..,2) is the upper error bar length in that case, etc.

     If marker=, msize=, or width= is specified, markers are positioned
     at X, Y using plmk.  Use the mfill=1 keyword to get filled markers
     (width>=10. in plmk; width= refers to error bar width in pleb).

   EXAMPLE:
      x = [0, 1, 2, 3];
      y = [0, 2, 4, 7];
      pleb, y, x, dx=0.2, dy=[0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.3], mfill=1;
         Uncertainties on dx are the same for all X, and those
         on Y are different for each value of Y.  Filled markers
         will be displayed at (X, Y).
