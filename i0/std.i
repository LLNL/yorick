    The Codger automatic code generator program uses this file to
    generate appropriate C code to initialize the various built-in
    functions declared here.
    This file is also used as online documentation for these functions
    by Yorick's help mechanism.

    The "extern" declaration of each function or variable is a no-op,
    but causes Yorick to place the variable in the sourceList for this
    include file, making it available for online help.  The DOCUMENT
    comment is provided in a standard format to simplify manipulation
    of such comments by programs other than Yorick;  it should immediately
    follow the corresponding "extern" so that it will be visible when
    the page containing the "extern" is displayed.

    The Codger code generator finds each "extern" line and creates
    initialization code binding the associated Yorick variable to
    either a BuiltIn function (see ydata.h) Y_variable, or, if a
    "reshape, variable, ..." declaration is found, to a global
    compiled variable y_variable with the compiled data type
    corresponding to the Yorick data type mentioned in the "reshape"
    command.  Codger can generate certain simple Y_variable wrapper
    routines if further information is provided in a PROTOTYPE comment.

extern help;
/* DOCUMENT help, topic
         or help
     Prints DOCUMENT comment from include file in which the variable
     TOPIC was defined, followed by the line number and filename.
     By opening the file with a text editor, you may be able to find
     out more, especially if no DOCUMENT comment was found.
     Examples:
       help, set_path
     prints the documentation for the set_path function.
       help
     prints the DOCUMENT comment you are reading.

     This copy of Yorick was launched from the directory:
     **** Y_LAUNCH (computed at runtime) ****
     Yorick's "site directory" at this site is:
     **** Y_SITE (computed at runtime) ****
     You can find out a great deal more about Yorick by browsing
     through these directories.  Begin with the site directory,
     and pay careful attention to the subdirectories doc/ (which
     contains documentation relating to Yorick), and i/ and
     contrib/ (which contain many examples of Yorick programs).
     Look for files called README (or something similar) in any
     of these directories -- they are intended to assist browsers.
     The site directory itself contains std.i and graph.i, which
     are worth reading.

     Type:
       help, dbexit

extern wrap_args;
/* DOCUMENT wrap_args, interpreted_function
     converts INTERPRETED_FUNCTION to a wrapped_func object,
     which will accept an arbitrary argument list, then invoke
     INTERPRETED_FUNCTION with a single wrapped_args object as
     its argument.  The INTERPRETED_FUNCTION must be declared as:

     func INTERPRETED_FUNCTION(args)
     {
       ...use args object to retrieve actual arguments...
     }
     wrap_args, INTEPRETED_FUNCTION;

     After wrapping, you invoke the function as usual:

     result = INTERPRETED_FUNCTION(arg1, key1=ka1, arg2, ...);

     Unlike an ordinary interpreted function, a wrapped function
     will accept any number of arguments, and keyword arguments
     of any name.  Furthermore, unlike an ordinary function, you
     can determine the number of arguments passed to the function,
     the names of any simple variable references passed to the
     function, and other useful information about the arguments.
     You can set the external value of any simple variable passed
     as an argument, as if it had been declared func f(..., &x, ...).

     A wrapped_func function call is less efficient and requires
     less transparent coding than an ordinary function call; the
     advantage is that you can write a wrapped function which has
     non-standard semantics, for example, like the save and restore
     built-in functions (which use the names of the arguments passed
     to them), or other special effects, like accepting arbitrary
     keyword names.

     The ARGS object, the single argument actually passed to
     your INTEPRETED_FUNCTION, is a wrapped_args object, which has
     the following Eval methods:

       ARGS(-)   returns [keyname1, keyname2, keyname3, ...]
                   the actual names of the keyword arguments passed
                   or nil [] if no keywords were passed
                   ARGS(*,) is a synonym for ARGS(-) to resemble
                   the object syntax (see help,oxy), although the
                   analogy is not exact.
       ARGS(0)   returns the number of positional arguments passed
                   ARGS(*) is a synonym for ARGS(0) to resemble
                   the object syntax (see help,oxy), although the
                   analogy is not exact.
       ARGS(i)   returns the i-th positional argument
                   i can also be a string to return a keyword argument,
                     or a negative number to return the -i-th keyword
       ARGS, i, value
                 sets the value of argument i, as if it were
                   an output variable declared as func f(..., &x, ...)
       ARGS(-,i) returns the name of argument i if it was
                   passed as a simple variable reference
                   ARGS(*,i) is a synonym for ARGS(-,i) to resemble
                   the object syntax (see help,oxy), although the
                   analogy is not exact.
       ARGS(0,i) returns a flag describing the argument:
         0 if argument is a simple variable reference (set value works)
         1 if argument is an expression (set value will be discarded)
         2 if argument does not exist (as opposed to simply nil)
     For obscure situations, there is also:
       ARGS(i,:) same as ARGS(i), except if the argument is an lvalue,
                   it is not fetched.
     This rather arcane feature permits you to pass an argument of the
     form f.x, where f is a file handle, to functions like dimsof or
     structof without triggering a read of the file.  Do not assign
     the result to a variable; use it only as an argument to another
     function.  The first time you call ARGS(i) for argument i, the
     lvalue is fetched, and ARGS(i,:) will do nothing special.

     can be used to produce arrays with other origins.

     Initially, the origin of an array index is ignored by Yorick; the
     first element of any array has index 1.  You can change this
     default behavior by calling use_origins with non-zero DONT_FORCE,
     and restore the default behavior by calling use_origins(0).

     When the returned object DUMMY is destroyed, either by return from
     the function in which it is a local variable, or by explicit
     redefintion of the last reference to it, the treatment of array
     index origins reverts to the behavior prior to the call to

         or grow(x, xnext1, xnext2, ...)
         or    _(x, xnext1, xnext2, ...)
     lengthens the array X by appending XNEXT1, XNEXT2, etc. to its
     final dimension.  If X is nil, X is first redefined to the first
     non-nil XNEXT, and the remainder of the XNEXT list is processed
     normally.  Each XNEXT is considered to have the same number of
     dimensions as X, by appending unit-length dimensions if necessary.
     All but this final dimension of each XNEXT must be right-conformable
     (that is, conformable in the sense of the right hand side of an
     assignment statement) with all but the final dimension of X.
     The result has a final dimension which is the sum of the final
     dimension of X and all the final dimensions of the XNEXT.  Nil
     XNEXT are ignored.  The value of the result is obtained by
     concatenating all the XNEXT to X, after any required broadcasts.

     If invoked as a function, grow returns the new value of X; in
     this case, X may be an expression.  X must be a simple variable
     reference for the subroutine form of grow; otherwise there is
     nowhere to return the result.  The subroutine form is slightly
     more efficient than the function form for the common usage:
          x= grow(x, xnext1, xnext2)           is the same as
          grow, x, xnext1, xnext2              the preferred form

     The _ function is a synonym for grow, for people who want this
     operator to look like punctuation in their source code, on analogy
     with the array building operator [a, b, c, ...].

     The _cat function is sometimes more appropriate than grow.

     Usage note:
     Never do this:
       while (more_data) grow, result, datum;
     The time to complete this loop scales as the SQUARE of the number
     of passes!  Instead, do this:
       for (i=1,result=array(things,n_init) ; more_data ; i++) {
         if (i>numberof(result)) grow, result, result;
         result(i) = datum;
       }
       result = result(1:i-1);
     The time to complete this loop scales as n*log(n), because the
     grow operation doubles the length of the result each time.

     of the scalar is the dimension to which the 1st dimension will move.

     Examples:  Let x have dimsof(x) equal [6, 1,2,3,4,5,6] in order
        to be able to easily identify a dimension by its length. Then:
        dimsof(x)                          == [6, 1,2,3,4,5,6]
        dimsof(transpose(x))               == [6, 6,2,3,4,5,1]
        dimsof(transpose(x,[1,2]))         == [6, 2,1,3,4,5,6]
        dimsof(transpose(x,[1,0]))         == [6, 6,2,3,4,5,1]
        dimsof(transpose(x,2))             == [6, 6,1,2,3,4,5]
        dimsof(transpose(x,0))             == [6, 2,3,4,5,6,1]
        dimsof(transpose(x,3))             == [6, 5,6,1,2,3,4]
        dimsof(transpose(x,[4,6,3],[2,5])) == [6, 1,5,6,3,2,4]

/* DOCUMENT string
 *
 * The yorick string datatype is a character string, e.g.- "Hello, world!".
 * Internally, strings are stored as 0-terminated sequences of characters,
 * which are 8-bit bytes, the same as the char datatype..
 *
 * Like numeric datatypes, string behaves as a function to convert objects
 * to the string datatype.  There are only two interesting conversions:
 *   string(0) is the nil string, like a 0 pointer
 *     This is the only string which is "false" in an if test.
 *   string(pc) where pc is an array of type pointer where each pointer
 *     is either 0 or points to an array of type char, copies the chars
 *     into an array of strings, adding a trailing '\0' if necessary
 *   pointer(sa) where sa is an array of stringa is the inverse
 *     conversion, copying each string to an array of char (including the
 *     terminal '\0') and returning an array of pointers to them
 * The strchar() function may be a more convenient way to convert from
 * string to char and back.
 *
 * Yorick provides the following means of manipulating string variables:
 *
 * s+t         when s and t are strings, + means concatentation
 *             (this is not perfect nomenclature, since t+s != s+t)
 * s(,sum,..)  the sum index range concatentates along a dimension of
 *             an array of strings
 * sum(s)      concatenates all the strings in an array (in storage order)
 *
 * strlen(s)          returns length(s) of string(s) s
 * strcase(upper, s)  converts s to upper or lower case
 * strchar(s_or_c)    converts between string and char arrays
 *                    (quick and dirty alternative to string<->pointer)
 * strpart(s, m:n)
 * strpart(s, sel)    extracts substrings (sel is a [start,end] list)
 *   string search functions:
 * strglob(pat, s)    shell-like wildcard pattern match, returns 0 or 1
 * strword(s, delim)  parses s into word(s), returns a sel
 * strfind(pat, s)    simple pattern match, returns a sel
 * strgrep(pat, s)    regular expression pattern match, returns a sel
 * streplace(s, sel, t)  replaces sel in s by t
 *
 * strtrim trims leading and/or trailing blanks (based on strword)
 * strmatch is a wrapper for strfind that simply returns whether there
 *   was a match or not rather than its exact offset
 * strtok is a variant of strword that calls strpart in order to
 *   return the substrings rather than an sel index list
 *
 * The strword, strfind, and strgrep functions produce a sel, that is,
 * a list of [start,end] offsets into an array of strings.
 * These sel indicate portions of a string to be operated on for the
 * strpart and streplace functions.
 *
 * The sread, swrite, and print functions operate on or produce strings.
 * The rdline, rdfile, read, and write functions perform I/O on strings
 * to text files.

     lengths of the strings.  Both string(0) and "" have length 0.

 */

extern strchar;
/* DOCUMENT strchar(string_array)
         or strchar(char_array)
     converts STRING_ARRAY to an array of characters, or CHAR_ARRAY
     to an array of strings.  The return value is always a 1D array,
     except in the second form if CHAR_ARRAY contains only a single
     string, the result will be a scalar string.  Each string is
     stored in sequence including its trailing '\0' character, with
     any string(0) elements treated as if they were "".  Going in
     the opposite direction, a '\0' before any non-'\0' characters
     produces string(0), so that "" can never be an element of
     the result, and if the final char (of the leading dimension)
     is not '\0', an implicit '\0' is assumed beyond the end of the
     input char array.  For example,
        strchar(["a","b","c"]) --> ['a','\0','b','\0','c','\0']
        strchar([['a','\0','b'],['c','\0','\0']]) --> ["a","b","c",string(0)]
     The string and pointer data types themselves also convert between
     string and char data, avoiding the quirks of strchar.
   SEE ALSO: string, strpart, strword, strfind
 */

extern strpart;
/* DOCUMENT strpart(string_array, m:n)
         or strpart(string_array, start_end)
         or strpart, string_array, start_end
    returns another string array with the same dimensions as
    STRING_ARRAY which consists of characters M through N of
    the original strings.  M and N are 1-origin indices; if
    M is omitted, the default is 1; if N is omitted, the default
    is the end of the string.  If M or N is non-positive, it is
    interpreted as an index relative to the end of the string,
    with 0 being the last character, -1 next to last, etc.
    Finally, the returned string will be shorter than N-M+1
    characters if the original doesn't have an Mth or Nth
    character, with "" (note that this is otherwise impossible)
    if neither an Mth nor an Nth character exists.  A 0
    is returned for any string which was 0 on input.

    In the second form, START_END is an array of [start,end] indices.
    A single pair [start,end] is equivalent to the range start+1:end,
    that is, start is the index of the character immediately before
    the substring (which is to say start is the number of characters
    skipped at the beginning of the string).  If end<start, or if
    either start or end are <0 or >length, or if the original string
    is string(0), strpart returns string(0); otherwise, if end==start,
    strpart returns "".

    However, the START_END array may have any additional dimensions
    (beyond the leading dimension of length 2) which are conformable
    with the dimensions of the STRING_ARRAY.  The result will be a
    string array with dimensions dimsof(STRING_ARRAY,START_END(1,..)).
    Furthermore, the leading dimension of START_END may have any
    even length, say 2*n, in which case the leading dimension of
    the result will be n.  For example,
      strpart(a, [s1,e1,s2,e2,s3,e3,s4,e4])
    is equivalent to (or shorthand for)
      strpart(a(-,..), [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],[s3,e3],[s4,e4]])(1,..)

    In the third form, called a subroutine, strpart operates on
    STRING_ARRAY in place.  In this case START_END must have
    leading dimension of length 2, although it may have trailing
    dimensions as usual.

    Examples:
    strpart("Hello, world!", 4:6) --> "lo,"
    strpart("Hello, world!", [3,6]) --> "lo,"
      -it may help to think of [start,end] as the 0-origin offset
       of a "cursor" between the characters of the string
    strpart("Hello, world!", [3,3]) --> ""
    strpart("Hello, world!", [3,2]) --> string(0)
    strpart("Hello, world!", [3,20]) --> string(0)
    strpart("Hello, world!", [3,6,7,9]) --> ["lo,","wo"]
    strpart(["one","two"], [[1,2],[0,1]]) --> ["n","t"]
    strpart(["one","two"], [1,2,0,1]) --> [["n","o"],["w","t"]]

extern strcase;
/* DOCUMENT strcase(upper, string_array)
         or strcase, upper, string_array
     returns STRING_ARRAY with all strings converted to upper case
     if UPPER is non-zero.  If UPPER is zero, result is lower case.
     (For characters >=0x80, the case conversion assumes the ISO8859-1
      character set.)
     Called as a subroutine, strcase converts STRING_ARRAY in place.

extern strword;
/* DOCUMENT strword(string_array)
         or strword(string_array, delim)
         or strword(string_array, delim, n)
         or strword(string_array, off, delim, n)
     scans to the first character in STRING_ARRAY which is not in
     the DELIM list.  DELIM defaults to " \t\n", that is, whitespace.
     The return value is a [start,end] offset pair, with trailing
     dimensions matching the dimensions of the given STRING_ARRAY.
     Note that this return value is suitable for use in the strpart
     or streplace functions.

     If the first character of DELIM is "^", the sense is reversed;
     strword scans to the first character in DELIM.  (Except that
     if DELIM is the single character "^", it has its usual meaning.)
     Also, a "-" which is not the first (or second after "^") or last
     character of DELIM indicates a range of characters.  Finally,
     if DELIM is "" or string(0), the scan stops immediately, since
     the first character (no matter what it is) is not in DELIM.

     Furthermore, DELIM can be a list of delimiter sets, where each
     element of the list delimits a new word, so the return value will
     be [start1,end1, ..., startN,endN], where N=numberof(DELIM),
     and start1 is the offset of the first character not in DELIM(1),
     characters with offset between end1 and start2 are in DELIM(2),
     characters with offset between end2 and start3 are in DELIM(3),
     and so on.  If endM is the length of the string for some M<N,
     then all subsequent start,end pairs will be endM,-1.  Note that
     endN is always the length of the string.

     If N is specified, the final DELIM will be repeated N times, so
     the leading dimension of the result is 2*(numberof(DELIM)+N-1).
     Thus, instead of DELIM = [d1,d2,d3,d3,d3,d3,d3], you may specify
     DELIM = [d1,d2,d3] and N = 5.  (By default, N=1.)

     If OFF is supplied (it is distinguished from DELIM by the
     fact that DELIM is a string or [], while OFF is an integer),
     it represents the offset (0-origin character index) in
     STRING_ARRAY at which the word search is to begin.  (DELIM
     or N may be omitted to get their default values.)  The OFF
     may be a scalar or an array conformable with STRING_ARRAY.
     The returned offsets include OFF; you do not need to add OFF
     to the return value to get the offsets into STRING_ARRAY.

     The action of strword can be described as follows: If d1 is
     the first delimiter, d2 is the second delimiter, and so on,
     then the input element of STRING_ARRAY looks like this:
          d1 word1 d2 word2 d3 word3 d4 word4 ...
     The offset array returned by strword will select word1, word2,
     word3, etc., if used in strpart.  One defect of this system is
     that the final word has no trailing delimiter - it always
     extends to the end of the string.

     To remedy this defect, N<0 is interpreted as follows: It is
     the same as abs(N), except that the final [start,end] pair is
     supressed; that is, if you have specified N delimiters, only
     N-1 words will be returned.

     As a second special case, N=0 forces the final delimeter to be
     at the end of the string, rather than as soon after the previous
     endM as possible.  Like N<0, this reduces the number of start,end
     pairs by one.  (N=0 is useful, for example, in order to trim
     trailing blanks.)

     Examples:
     strword("  Hello, world!") --> [2,15]
     strword("Hello, world!") --> [0,13]
     strword("Hello, world!", , 2) --> [0,6,7,13]
     strword("Hello, world!", , -2) --> [0,6]
     strword("Hello, world!", ".!, \t\n", -2) --> [0,5]
     strword("Hello, world!", [string(0), ".!, \t\n"], 0) --> [0,12]
     strword("Hello, world!", "A-Za-z", 2) --> [5,7,12,13]
     strword("Hello, world!", "^A-Za-z", 2) --> [0,5,7,13]
     strword("Hello, world!", "^A-Za-z", 3) --> [0,5,7,12,13,-1]
     strword("  Hello, world!", [" \t\n",".!, \t\n"]) --> [2,7,9,15]
     strword("  Hello, world!", [" \t\n",".!, \t\n"], 2) --> [2,7,9,14,15,-1]

     A token is delimited by any of the characters in the string
     DELIM.  If DELIM is blank, nil, or not given, the

     The result is a string array ts with dimensions
     2-by-dimsof(STRING_ARRAY); ts(1,) is the first token, and
     ts(2,) is the remainder of the string (the character which
     terminated the first token will be in neither of these parts).
     The ts(2,) part will be 0 (i.e.- the null string) if no more
     characters remain after ts(1,); the ts(1,) part will be 0 if
     no token was present.  A STRING_ARRAY element may be 0, in
     which case (0, 0) is returned for that element.

     With yorick-1.6, strtok has been extended to accept multiple

     N for the final DELIM set.  The operation is the same as for
     strword, except that the N<=0 special cases are illegal, and

     PAT can contain UNIX shell wildcard or "globbing" characters:

     The strglob function is mostly intended for matching lists of

     the entire string must match PAT.

     Keywords:

     The strfind function is the simpler string pattern matcher:
     strfind - just finds a literal pattern (possibly case insensitive)
     strgrep - matches a pattern containing complex regular expressions
     Additionally, the strglob function does filename wildcard matching.

    The underlying compiled routine is based on the regexp package
    written by Henry Spencer (copyright University of Toronto 1986),
    slightly modified for yorick.

    PAT is a regular expression, simliar to the UNIX grep utility.
    Every "regular expression" syntax is slightly different; here is
    the syntax supported by strgrep:

    The following characters in PAT have special meanings:

    '[' followed by any sequence of characters followed by ']' is a
        "range", which matches any single one of those characters
        '^' first means to match any character NOT one in the sequence
        '-' in such a sequence indicates a range of characters
          (e.g.- "[A-Za-z0-9_]" matches any alphanumeric character
           or underscore, while "[^A-Za-z0-9_]" matches anything else)
        to include ']' in the sequence, place it first,
        to include '-' in the sequence, place it first or last
          (or first after a leading '^' in either case)
        Note that the following special characters lose their special
        meanings inside a range.
    '.' matches any single character
    '^' matches the beginning of the string (but no characters)
    '$' matches the end of the string (but no characters)
        (that is, ^ and $ serve to anchor a search so that it will
         only find a match at the beginning or end of the string)
    '\' (that is, a single backslash, which can only be entered
         into a yorick string by a double backslash "\\")
        followed by any single character eliminates any special
        meaning for that character, for example "\\." matches
        period, rather than any single character (its special meaning)
    '(' followed by a regular expression followed by ')' matches the
        regular expression, creating a sub-pattern, which is a type
        of atom (see below)
    '|' means "or"; it separates branches in a regular expression
    '*' after an atom matches 0 or more matches of the atom
    '+' after an atom matches 1 or more matches of the atom
    '?' after an atom matches 0 or 1 matches of the atom

    The definitions of "atom", "branch", and "regular expression" are:

    A "regular expression" (which is what PAT is) consists of zero
    or more "branches" separated by '|'; it matches anything that
    matches one of the branches.

    A "branch" consists of zero or more "pieces", concatenated; it
    matches a match for the first followed by a match for the second,
    etc.

    A "piece" is an "atom", optionally followed by '*', '+', or '?';
    it matches the atom, or zero or more repetitions of the atom, as
    specified by the optional suffix.

    Finally, an "atom" is an ordinary single character, or a
    '\'-escaped single character (matching that character), or
    one of the special characters '.', '^', or '$', or a
    []-delimited range (matching any single character in the range),
    or a sub-pattern enclosed in () (matching the sub-pattern).

    A maximum of nine sub-patterns is allowed in PAT; these are
    numbered 1 through 9, in order of their opening '(' in PAT.

    This recursive definition of regular expressions often leads to
    ambiguities, both subtle and glaring.  Here is Henry Spencer's
    synopsis of how his routines behave:

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    If a regular expression could match two different parts of the
    input string, it will match the one which begins earliest.  If both
    begin in the same place but match different lengths, or match the
    same length in different ways, life gets messier, as follows.

    In general, the possibilities in a list of branches are considered
    in left-to-right order, the possibilities for `*', `+', and `?' are
    considered longest-first, nested constructs are considered from the
    outermost in, and concatenated constructs are considered leftmost-
    first.  The match that will be chosen is the one that uses the
    earliest possibility in the first choice that has to be made.  If
    there is more than one choice, the next will be made in the same
    manner (earliest possibility) subject to the decision on the first
    choice.  And so forth.

    For example, `(ab|a)b*c' could match `abc' in one of two ways. The
    first choice is between `ab' and `a'; since `ab' is earlier, and
    does lead to a successful overall match, it is chosen. Since the
    `b' is already spoken for, the `b*' must match its last possibility
    -the empty string- since it must respect the earlier choice.

    In the particular case where no `|'s are present and there is only
    one `*', `+', or `?', the net effect is that the longest possible
    match will be chosen.  So `ab*', presented with `xabbbby', will
    match `abbbb'.  Note that if `ab*' is tried against `xabyabbbz', it
    will match `ab' just after `x', due to the begins-earliest rule.
    (In effect, the decision on where to start the match is the first
    choice to be made, hence subsequent choices must respect it even if
    this leads them to less-preferred alternatives.)
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

    When PAT contains parenthesized sub-patterns, strgrep returns
    the [start,end] of the entire match by default, but you can
    also get the [start,end] of any or all of the sub-patterns
    using the sub= keyword (see below).

    If PAT does not contain any regular expression constructs, you
    should use the strfind function instead of strgrep.  The strglob
    function, if appropriate, will also be faster than strgrep.

    Keywords:
    n=  (default 1) returns list of first n matches, so leading
        dimension of result will be 2*n
    sub=[n1,n2,...] is a list of the sub-pattern [start,end] pairs
        to be returned.  Thus 0 is the whole PAT, 1 is the first
        parenthesized sub-pattern, and so on.  The leading
        dimension of the result will be 2*numberof(sub)*n.  The
        sequence n1,n2,... must strictly increase: n1<n2<...
        The default is sub=0, which returns only the whole match.

    Examples:
    s = "Hello, world!"
    strgrep("(Hello|Goodbye), *([a-zA-Z]+)!", s)
      --> [0,13]
    strgrep("(Hello|Goodbye), *([a-z]*|[A-Z]*)!", s, sub=[1,2])
      --> [0,5,7,12]
    strgrep("(Hello|Goodbye), *([a-z]*|[A-Z]*)!", s, sub=[0,2])
      --> [0,13,7,12]
    strgrep("(Hello|Goodbye), *(([A-Z]*)|([a-z]*))!", s, sub=[0,2,3,4])
      --> [0,13,7,12,13,-1,7,12]

extern streplace;
/* DOCUMENT streplace(string_array, start_end, to_string)
     replaces the part(s) START_END of STRING_ARRAY by TO_STRING.
     The leading dimension of START_END must be a multiple of 2,
     while any trailing dimensions must be conformable with the
     dimensions of STRING_ARRAY.  The TO_STRING must be conformable
     with STRING_ARRAY if the leading dimension of START_END is 2.
     An element of START_END may represent "no match" (for example,
     when end<start), in which case streplace silently skips the
     replacement.  Note that when start==end, streplace functions
     as text insertion.

     However, if the leading dimension of START_END = 2*n > 2, then
     TO_STRING must have a leading dimension conformable with n
     (that is, of length either 1 or n).  In this case, streplace
     performs multiple replacements within each string.  In order
     for multiple replacements to be meaningful, the START_END
     must be disjoint and sorted, as returned by strfind or
     strgrep with a repeat count, or by strword.  In other words,
     the first dimension of START_END should be non-decreasing,
     except where end<start indicates no replacement.

     Invoked as a subroutine, streplace operates on STRING_ARRAY
     in place.

     Examples:
     s = "Hello, world!"
     streplace(s,[0,5], "Goodbye")
       -->  "Goodbye, world!"
     streplace(s,[0,5,7,7], ["Goodbye","cruel "])
       -->  "Goodbye, cruel world!"
     streplace(s,[0,5,7,7,12,13], ["Goodbye","cruel ","?"])
       -->  "Goodbye, cruel world?"
     streplace(s,[0,5,0,-1,12,13], ["Goodbye","cruel ","?"])
       -->  "Goodbye, world?"
     streplace([s,s],[0,5], ["Goodbye", "Good bye"])
       -->  ["Goodbye, world!", "Good bye, world!"]
     streplace([s,s],[0,5,7,7], [["Goodbye","cruel "], ["Good bye",""]])
       -->  ["Goodbye, cruel world!", "Good bye, world!"]

extern open;
/* DOCUMENT f= open(filename)
         or f= open(filename, filemode)
         or f= open(filename, filemode, errmode)
     opens the file FILENAME according to FILEMODE (both are strings).
     If ERRMODE is non-nil and non-zero, fail by returning nil F,
     otherwise failure to open or create the file is a runtime error.

     To use ERRMODE to check for the existence of a file:
        if (open(filename,"r",1)) file_exists;
        else file_does_not_exist;

     The return value F is an IOStream (or just stream for short).  When
     the last reference to this return value is discarded, the file will
     be closed.  The file can also be explicitly closed with the close
     function.  The FILEMODE determines whether the file is to be
     opened in read, write, or update mode, and whether writes are
     restricted to the end-of-file (append mode).  FILEMODE also
     determines whether the file is opened as a text file or as a
     binary file.  FILEMODE can have the following values, which are
     the same as for the ANSI standard fopen function:
        "r"     - read only
        "w"     - write only, random access, existing file overwritten
        "a"     - write only, forced to end-of-file,
                existing file preserved
        "r+"    - read/write, random access, existing file preserved
        "w+"    - read/write, random access, existing file overwritten
        "a+"    - read/write, reads random access,
                writes forced to end-of-file, existing file preserved
        "rb"  "wb"  "ab"  "r+b"  "rb+"  "w+b"  "wb+"  "a+b"  "ab+"
                without b means text file, with b means binary file
     The default FILEMODE is "r" -- open an existing text file for
     reading.

     The read and write functions perform I/O on text files.
     I/O to binary files may be performed explicitly using the save
     and restore functions, or implicitly by using the stream variable
     F as if it were a data structure instance (e.g.- f.x refers to
     variable x in the binary file f).

     unless the optional second argument is non-nil and non-zero, as in

     char array.  Any dimensions of a char array are ignored in either

     is treated as one line of text.  For a text file char array, "\n",
     "\r", "\r\n", or "\0" are all recognized as newline markers.  These
     are read only files.

     If SOURCE is nil, the file handle will be read-write.  After writing
     the in-memory file, you can retrieve the finished array with the
     vclose function.  If the file is text, the array will be an array of

         or n= read(prompt= pstring, format=fstring, obj1, obj2, ...)
         or n= sread(source, format=fstring, obj1, obj2, ...)
     reads text from I/O stream F (1st form), or from the keyboard (2nd
     form), or from the string or string array SOURCE (3rd form),
     interprets it according to the optional FSTRING, and uses that
     interpretation to assign values to OBJ1, OBJ2, ...  If the input
     is taken from the keyboard, the optional prompt PSTRING (default
     "read> ") is printed before each line is read.  The Yorick write
     function does not interact with the read function -- writes are
     always to end-of-file, and do not affect the sequence of lines
     returned by read.  The backup (and bookmark) function is the
     only way to change the sequence of lines returned by read.

     There must be one non-supressed conversion specifier (see below)
     in FSTRING for each OBJ to be read; the type of the conversion
     specifier must generally match the type of the OBJ.  That is,
     an integer OBJ requires an integer specifier (d, i, o, u, or x)
     in FSTRING, a real OBJ requires a real specifier (e, f, or g),
     and a string OBJ requires a string specifier (s or []).  An OBJ
     may not be complex, a pointer, a structure instance, or any non-
     array Yorick object.  If FSTRING is not supplied, or if it has
     fewer conversion specifiers than the number of OBJ arguments,
     then Yorick supplies default specifiers ("%ld" for integers,
     "%lg" for reals, and "%s" for strings).  If FSTRING contains more
     specifiers than there are OBJ arguments, the part of FSTRING
     beginning with the first specifier with no OBJ is ignored.

     The OBJ may be scalar or arrays, but the dimensions of every OBJ
     must be identical.  If the OBJ are arrays, Yorick behaves as
     if the read were called in a loop numberof(OBJ1) times, filling
     one array element of each of the OBJ according to FSTRING on
     each pass through the loop.  (Note that this behavior includes
     the case of reading columns of numbers by a single call to read.)

     The return value N is the total number of scalar assignments
     which were made as a result of this call.  (If there were 4
     OBJ arguments, and each was an array with 17 elements, a return
     value of N==35 would mean the following:  The first 8 elements
     of OBJ1, OBJ2, OBJ3, and OBJ4 were read, and the 9th element of
     OBJ1, OBJ2, and OBJ3 was read.)  The read function sets any
     elements of the OBJ which were not read to zero -- hence,
     independent of the returned N, the all of the old data in the
     OBJ arguments is overwritten.

     The read or sread functions continue reading until either:
     (1) all elements of all OBJ have been filled, or (2) end-of-file
     (or end of SOURCE for sread) is reached ("input failure"), or
     (3) part of FSTRING or a conversion specifier supplied by
     default fails to match the source text ("matching failure").

     The FSTRING is composed of a series of "directives" which are
     (1) whitespace -- means to skip any amount of whitespace in the
         source text
     (2) characters other than whitespace and % -- must match the
         characters in the source text exactly, or matching failure
         occurs and the read operation stops
     (3) conversion specifiers beginning with % and ending with a
         character specifying the type of conversion -- optionally
         skip whitespace, then convert as many characters as
         continue to "look like" the conversion type, possibly
         producing a matching failure
     The conversion specifier is of the form %*WSC, where:
     * is either the character '*' or not present
       A specifier beginning with %* does not correspond to any of
       the OBJ; the converted value will be discarded.
     W is either a positive decimal integer specifying the maximum
       field width (not including any skipped leading whitespace),
       or not present if any number of characters up to end-of-line
       is acceptable.
     S is either one of the characters 'h', 'l', or 'L', or not
       present.  Yorick allows this for compatibility with the C
       library functions, but ignores it.
     C is a character specifying the type of conversion:
       d   - decimal integer
       i   - decimal, octal (leading 0), or hex (leading 0x) integer
       o   - octal integer
       u   - unsigned decimal integer (same as d for Yorick)
       x, X            - hex integer
       e, f, g, E, G   - floating point real
       s   - string of non-whitespace characters
       [xxx]   - (xxx is any sequence of characters) longest string
                 of characters matching those in the list
       [^xxx]  - longest string of characters NOT matching those in
                 the list (this is how you can extend %s to be
                 delimited by something other than whitespace)
       %   - the ordinary % character; complete conversion
             specification must be "%%"

     The read function is modeled on the ANSI standard C library
     fscanf and sscanf functions, but differs in several respects:
       (1) Yorick's read cannot handle the %c, %p, or %n conversion
           specifiers in FSTRING.
       (2) Yorick's read never results in a portion of a line
           being read -- any unused part of a line is simply discarded
           (end FSTRING with "%[^\n]" if you want to save the trailing
           part of an input line).
       (3) As a side effect of (2), there are some differences between
           fscanf and Yorick's read in how whitespace extending across
           newlines is handled.

     writes text to I/O stream F (1st form), or to the terminal (2nd
     form), or to the STRINGS string array (3rd form), representing
     arrays OBJ1, OBJ2, ..., according to the optional FSTRING.  The
     optional linesize L defaults to 80 characters, and helps restrict
     line lengths when FSTRING is not given, or does not contain
     newline directives.  The write function always appends to the
     end of a text file; the position for a sequence of reads is
     not affected by intervening writes.

     There must be one conversion specifier (see below) in FSTRING for
     each OBJ to be written; the type of the conversion specifier must
     generally match the type of the OBJ.  That is, an integer OBJ
     requires an integer specifier (d, i, o, u, x, or c) in FSTRING,
     a real OBJ requires a real specifier (e, f, or g), a string OBJ
     requires the string specifier (s), and a pointer OBJ requires a
     the pointer specifier (p).  An OBJ may not be complex, a structure
     instance, or any non-array Yorick object.  If FSTRING is not
     supplied, or if it has fewer conversion specifiers than the
     number of OBJ arguments, then Yorick supplies default specifiers
     (" %8ld" for integers, " %14.6lg" for reals, " %s" for strings, and
     " %8p" for pointers).  If FSTRING contains more specifiers than
     there are OBJ arguments, the part of FSTRING beginning with the
     first specifier with no OBJ is ignored.

     The OBJ may be scalar or arrays, but the dimensions of the OBJ
     must be conformable.  If the OBJ are arrays, Yorick behaves as
     if he write were called in a loop dimsof(OBJ1, OBJ2, ...) times,
     writing one array element of each of the OBJ according to FSTRING
     on each pass through the loop.  The swrite function returns a
     string array with dimensions dimsof(OBJ1, OBJ2, ...).  The write
     function inserts a newline between passes through the array if
     the line produced by the previous pass did not end with a
     newline, and if the total number of characters output since the
     previous inserted newline, plus the number of characters about
     to be written on the current pass, would exceed L characters
     (L defaults to 80).  The write function returns the total
     number of characters output.

     The FSTRING is composed of a series of "directives" which are
     (1) characters other than % -- copied directly to output
     (2) conversion specifiers beginning with % and ending with a
         character specifying the type of conversion -- specify
         how to convert an OBJ into characters for output
     The conversion specifier is of the form %FW.PSC, where:
     F is zero or more optional flags:
       - left justify in field width
       + signed conversion will begin with either + or -
         (space) signed conversion  will begin with either space or -
       # alternate form (see description of each type below)
       0 pad field width with leading 0s instead of leading spaces
     W is either a decimal integer specifying the minimum field width
       (padded as specified by flags), or not present to use the
       minimum number of characters required.
     .P is either a decimal integer specifying the precision of the
       result, or not present to get the default.  For integers, this
       is the number of digits to be printed (possibly forcing leading
       zeroes), and defaults to 1.  For reals, this is the number of
       digits after the decimal point, and defaults to 6.  For strings,
       this is the maximum number of characters to print, and defaults
       to infinity.
     S is either one of the characters 'h', 'l', or 'L', or not
       present.  Yorick allows this for compatibility with the C
       library functions, but ignores it.
     C is a character specifying the type of conversion:
       d, i  - decimal integer
       o     - octal integer (# forces leading 0)
       u     - unsigned decimal integer (same as d for Yorick)
       x, X            - hex integer (# forces leading 0x)
       f     - floating point real in fixed point notation
               (# forces decimal)
       e, E  - floating point real in scientific notation
       g, G  - floating point real in fixed or scientific notation
               depending on the value converted (# forces decimal)
       s   - string of ASCII characters
       c   - integer printed as corresponding ASCII character
       p   - pointer
       %   - the ordinary % character; complete conversion
             specification must be "%%"

     The write function is modeled on the ANSI standard C library
     fprintf and sprintf functions, but differs in several respects:
       (1) Yorick's write cannot handle the %n conversion specifier
           in FSTRING.
       (2) Yorick's write may insert additional newlines if the OBJ
           are arrays, to avoid extremely long output lines.

extern require;
/* DOCUMENT #include "yorick_source.i"
            require, source
            include, source
         or include, source, now

     The SOURCE argument can be a scalar string, interpreted as a
     filename like "yorick_source.i", the text in a char array, or
     the text in a 1D array of strings (as returned by a two argument
     call to rdline).  This is the low level interface for executing
     text as yorick code.  Use the exec function for a higher level
     interface.  In particular, with NOW=1, a function with a catch
     call in the call tree of SOURCE will not work properly with
     include, but it will work with exec.

     #include is a parser directive, not a Yorick statement.  Use it
     to read Yorick source code which you have saved in a file; the
     file yorick_source.i will be read one line at a time, exactly as
     if you had typed those lines at the keyboard.  The following
     directories are searched (in this order) to find yorick_source.i:

        .               (current working directory)
        ~/yorick        (your personal directory of Yorick functions)
        ~/Yorick        (your personal directory of Yorick functions)
        Y_SITE/i        (Yorick distribution library)
        Y_SITE/contrib  (contributed source at your site)
        Y_SITE/i0       (Yorick startup and package include files)
        Y_HOME/lib      (Yorick architecture dependent include files)

     To find out what is available in the Y_SITE/i directory,
     type:
         library
     You can also type
         Y_SITE
     to find the name of the site directory at your site, go to the
     include or contrib subdirectory, and browse through the *.i files.
     This is a good way to learn how to write a Yorick program.  Be
     alert for files like README as well.

     The require function checks to see whether FILENAME has already
     been included (actually whether any file with the same final
     path component has been included).  If so, require is a no-op,
     otherwise, the action is the same as the include function with
     NOW == 1.

     The include function causes Yorick to parse and execute FILENAME
     immediately.  The effect is similar to the #include parser
     directive, except the finding, parsing, and execution of FILENAME
     occurs at runtime.  The NOW argument has the following meanings:
       NOW == -1   filename pushed onto stack, popped and parsed
                   when all pending input is exhausted
       NOW == 0    (or nil, default) parsed just before next input
                   line would be parsed
       NOW == 1    parsed immediately, resuming current interpreted
                   program when finished (like require)
       NOW == 2    like 0, except no error if filename does not exist
       NOW == 3    like 1, except no error if filename does not exist

/* DOCUMENT autoload, ifile, var1, var2, ...
         or autoload, ifile
     causes IFILE to be included when any of the variables VAR1, VAR2, ...
     is referenced as a function or subroutine.  Multiple autoload
     calls may refer to a single IFILE; the effect is cumulative.  Note
     that any reference to a single one of the VARi causes all of them
     to be replaced (when IFILE is included).
     The semantics of this process are complicated, but should work
     as expected in most cases: After the call to autoload, the VARi
     may not be redefined (e.g.- VARi=something or func VARi) without
     generating a warning message, and causing all the VARi for the
     same IFILE to become undefined.  The semantic subtlety arises
     from the yorick variable scoping rules; if any of the VARi has local
     scope for any function in the calling chain when the inclusion of
     IFILE is actually triggered, only those local values will be
     replaced.  (The autoload function is no different than the require
     or include functions in this regard.)
     The second form, with no VARi, cancels the autoload, without giving
     any warning; all the VARi become undefined.

     Before IFILE is included, the VARi behave like [] (nil) variables
     as far as their response to the is_void function, and the ! and ?
     operators.  (You can use is_func to discover whether a variable is
     an autoload.)  Only their actual use in a function or subroutine call
     will trigger the autoload.  While the IFILE may define the VARi
     as any type of object, the autoload feature only works as intended
     if the VARi are defined as interpreted or built-in functions.  The
     only way it makes sense for a VARi to be a built-in function, is
     if the IFILE executes a plug_in command to dynamically load an
     associated compiled library.

     If IFILE (or a file with the same name) has already been included,
     autoload is a silent no-op.  This is exactly analogous to the
     behavior of the require function; it does not harm to call either
     require or autoload if the IFILE has already been included.  Note
     that you may want to place a require at the beginning of a file
     you expect to be autoloaded, in preference to providing separate
     autoloads for the second file.

     creates an anonymous interpreted function from the input
     COMMAND_LINE, equivalent to
     func function {
       command_line;
     }
     The COMMAND_LINE string is restricted to the following
     format:
       "funcname arg1 arg2 ..."
     where each of the arguments is one of
     (a) a symbol (that is, a yorick variable name)
     (b) a decimal integer
     (c) a real number
     (d) a quoted string
     The quoted string is enclosed in double quotes, and a
     backslash can be used to escape a double quote or a
     backslash (but the other backslash escape sequences are
     not recognized and unnecessary - just insert the ascii code).

     Note that funcdef merely creates the function; if you want
     to execute it and discard it, use the following statement:
       funcdef(command_line);

     The huge advantage of funcdef over the full yorick parser
     is that it is stateless, which means you can invoke it to
     generate actions for event callbacks.  The extreme simplicity
     of the permitted COMMAND_LINE is not a limitation for this
     application, because you are free to invoke an arbitrarily
     complex "funcname", and to provide it with arbitrary inputs.

     The intent with funcdef is not to permit you to create an
     arbitrary toolkit of interpreted functions, but merely to
     allow you to invoke such a toolkit; the toolkit itself is
     supposed to be parsed by the ordinary include, require, or
     autoload mechanisms.  Generally, you will have to design
     an interpreted toolkit somewhat differently if it is to be
     invoked by funcdef.  For example, funcdef does not allow
     you to set variables as in x=value, but you can use the
     funcset (or similarly designed) function to set variables
     like this:
       funcdef("funcset x value")

     Do not attempt to use funcdef to input vast amounts of data.
     As a rule of thumb, if your funcdef strings have more than a
     couple of dozen tokens, you probably haven't thought hard
     enough about what you are doing.

/*= SECTION(plugin) loading plugins ========================================*/

extern plug_in;
/* DOCUMENT plug_in, "pkgname"

     Dynamically link to yorick package "pkgname".  The compiled
     functions of the package are in a shared object file; these
     files have a naming convention which differs slightly on different
     platforms.  On most UNIX systems (including Mac OS X), the
     binary file is named pkgname.so.  On MS Windows systems, the
     binary file is named pkgname.dll.  On HPUX systems, the name is
     pkgname.sl.  The "pkgname" argument to plug_in does not include
     this platform-dependent file extension, so that the yorick code
     containing the plug_in command will be portable.

     After dynamically linking the compiled routines in the pkgname
     shared object binary, yorick runs the function (which must be
     present) yk_pkgname in order to initialize the package.  At
     minimum yk_pkgname returns lists of the new compiled (builtin)
     functions defined by the package and the names by which they
     may be invoked by interpreted code.

     Additionally, yk_pkgname returns a list of files to be included
     containing interpreted wrapper functions for the compiled routines
     and DOCUMENT comments for the help system.  Conventionally, these
     include files are located in the Y_SITE/i0 or Y_HOME/lib directories,
     and the name (of one) of the file(s) is pkgname.i.  If the package
     has been statically linked (i.e.- not by plug_in), these .i files
     are automatically included when yorick starts.  However, if the
     package is loaded dynamically by plug_in, you must arrange to
     include one or all of these .i files as you would any interpreted
     package (e.g.- by the autoload or require functions, or manually).

     The upshot of all this is that the plug_in function is designed
     to be placed at the top of the .i files associated with the
     package.  You are not supposed to call plug_in manually, rather
     when you #include (or autoload) a .i file which needs compiled
     functions, that .i file invokes plug_in to perform any required
     dynamic linking to compiled code.  Thus, the end user does not
     do anything differently for a package that uses dynamically loaded
     compiled code, than for a purely interpreted package.

     Yorick dynamic library support solves a distribution problem.  For
     debugging and creating compiled packages for your own use, you want
     to build special versions of yorick with your compiled routines
     statically linked.  In order to support platforms on which there
     is no dynamic linking, if you call the plug_in function for a
     package that is statically linked (e.g.- plug_in,"yor"), the
     function will silently become a no-op when it notices that the
     "pkgname" package was already loaded at startup.

     The restore function may be used to make memory copies of data
     in the file; this will be faster than a large number of
     references to "file.var".
     The openb function will recognize families of PDB or netCDF files
     by their sequential names and open all files subsequent to FILENAME
     in such a family as well as FILENAME itself.  You can use the one=1
     keyword to suppress this behavior and open only FILENAME.
     FILENAME may be a file handle to skip the initial open operation.
     This feature is intended to enable in-memory files created with
     vopen to be opened:
       file = openb(vopen(char_array,1));
     FILENAME may also be char_array directly, as returned by vsave.

     The PDB file format comes in two styles, "Major-Order:101", and
     "Major-Order:102".  Yorick interprets these correctly by default,
     but other codes may ignore them, or write them incorrectly.

     Unlike Yorick, not all codes are able to correctly read both
     styles.  If you are writing a file which needs to be read by
     a "102 style" code, create it with the close102=1 keyword.

     If you notice that a file you though was a history file isn't, or
     that the dimensions of multi-dimensional variables are transposed
     from the order you expected, the code which wrote the file probably
     blew it.  Try openb("filename", open102=2).  The choices 1 and 3
     are for cases in which you know the writing code was supposed to
     write the file one way or the other, and you don't want to be
     bothered.

     corresponding to that VARi does not change.  Hence, groups are a
     way to maintain "namespaces" in yorick.  The return value from
     save is simply a group object containing the VARi.  The return
     value from restore is more interesting: it is a group object containing
     the values of the VARi before they were restored.  This enables you to
     put things back the way they were before a restore, after you are
     finished using the restored variables.

     Special cases of save:
       grp = save();   // return an empty group object
       obj = save(*);  // return the entire global symbol table as an object
       save, obj;      // saves entire global symbol table in OBJ, silently
         skipping any variables whose data type OBJ does not support
     Other special cases:
       restore, obj;   // restores all named variables in OBJ
       save, use, var1, var2, ...;
       restore, use, var1, var2, ...;
         save and restore to the current context object (see help,use).
         Normally you should use the use function, not these special forms.

     Each VARi may be a simple variable reference, in which case the name
     of the VARi specifies which member of the object.  (In the case of
     save, a VARi whose name matches no current object member will create
     a new object member of that name.)  However, any of the VARi may
     instead be be a pair of arguments instead of a single argument:
       VARi -->  MEMBSPECi, VALi
     where MEMBSPECi is an expression (but NOT a simple variable reference)
     whose value specifies which object member, and the VALi argument is
     the external value.  In the case of save, VALi may also be an
     expression; in the case of restore, VALi must be the simple variable
     reference for the variable which restore will set to the specified
     object member.  For example:
       var2 = 3*x+7;
       save, obj, var1, var2, var3;
       save, obj, var1, "var2", 3*x+7, var3;
       save, obj, var1, swrite(format="var%ld",8/4), 3*x+7, var3;
     All three save calls do the same thing.  The corresponding restore
     works by name; the order need not be the same as the save:
       restore, obj, var2, var3, var1;
     puts the saved values back where they started, while:
       restore, obj, var2, swrite(format="var%ld",1), x;
     puts var2 back to its saved value, but sets x to the value saved
     as var1.  You can use the noop() function to make an expression out
     of a variable holding a MEMBSPEC.  For example, if varname="var1", then
       restore, obj, noop(varname), x;  // or
       restore, obj, varname+"", x;
     will set x to the value saved as var1, while
       restore, obj, varname, x;   // error!
     attempts to restore two variables named "varname" and "x" from obj.

     For the save function, each VARi may also be a keyword argument:
       VARi -->  member=VALi
     which behaves exactly the same as:
       VARi -->  "member",VALi
     but is slightly more efficient, since it avoids the string argument.
     You can also omit the "save" in a subroutine call if all arguments
     are keywords:
       save, obj, m1=val1, m2=val2, ...;
     is the same thing as:
       obj, m1=val1, m2=val2, ...;

     Some kinds of objects (including the group objects, but usually not
     binary file handles) support anonymous members.  For such objects,
     the order in which the members were saved is significant, and member
     names are optional.  You can create anonymous members by passing
     string(0) to save as the MEMBSPEC.  Unlike ordinary names, each save
     with string(0) as the name creates a new member (rather than overwriting
     the existing member with that name).  All members (named as well as
     anonymous) are numbered starting from 1 for the first member, in the
     order in which they are created.  For objects supporting anonymous
     members, MEMBSPEC may also be an integer, which is the member index.

     In fact, MEMBSPECi can be any of the following:
     scalar string   - member name, string(0) on save creates anonymous member
     scalar index    - member index
     string array    - VALi a group with those members (string(0) on save OK)
     index array     - VALi a group with those members
     min:max:step    - VALi a group with those members
     nil []          - save only: if VALi is not an object, same as string(0),
       if VALi is an object, merge with OBJ, that is members of VALi become
       members of OBJ, creating or overwriting named members and always
       appending anonymous members.
     MEMBSPEC indices and index ranges accept zero or negative values with
     the same meaning as for array indices, namely 0 represents the last
     member, -1 the second to the last, and so on.  Unlike array indices,
     the non-positive index values also work in index array MEMBSPECs.

     See help,oxy (object extension to yorick) for more on objects.

     As a final remark, notice that you can use save and restore to
     construct group objects without having any side effects -- that is,
     without "damaging" the state of any other variables.  For example,
     suppose we want to create an object bump consisting of three
     variables x, y, and z, that need to be computed.  In order to do
     that without clobbering existing values of x, y, and z, or anything
     else, we can do this:
       bump = save(x, y, z);        // save current values of x, y, z
       scratch = save(scratch, xy); // save scratch variables (xy and scratch)
       xy = span(-4, 4, 250);
       x = xy(,-:1:250);
       y = xy(-:1:250,);
       z = sqrt(0.5/pi)*exp(-0.5*abs(x,y)^2);
       bump = restore(bump);        // put back old x,y,z, set bump to new
       restore, scratch;            // restore xy and scratch itself

     If both FILE and TIME are specified and jt is called as a function,

   N.B.: "jt, file" and "jt, file, -" are obsolete.  Use the jr function to

     If only the FILE is specified, increment the current record of that

     If the current record is the last, "jt, file" unsets the current record
     so that record variables will be inaccessible until another jt or jc.
     The same thing happens with "jt, file, -" if the current record was the

     If only FILE is specified, jt returns 1 if there is a new current

     for subsequent save commands to actually write the data.

     The TIME, NCYC, and ADDRESS arguments may be equal length vectors

 *  for sending messages between the two processes.  In order to make the
 *  connection, one of the two processes must act as a server, which
 *  listens for the second process to attempt to connect to it.  The
 *  listener itself is a special socket, which listens for connections
 *  on a specific port, which can be any number less than 2^16 (65536).
 *  Port numbers below 1024 are reserved for registered system services,
 *  such as port 80, which is used for http connections, or port 22,
 *  which is for ssh connections.
 *
 *  While socket(port) creates a listener for a specific port, you are
 *  only guaranteed not to collide with another program if you omit the
 *  port, socket(), or pass port 0, socket(0), which means that you want
 *  the operating system to choose an unused port number for you.  After
 *  socket(0) returns the listener, you can find the actual port number
 *  which the system chose with listener.port.
 *
 *  The second process must actively seek the connection, so it needs
 *  to pass both the machine address addr (like "www.example.com") of
 *  the listening process, as well as the port number on which it is
 *  listening.  Usually, the connecting process will be running on the
 *  same machine as the listening process (your firewall should probably
 *  block inter-machine traffic on a random port number).  To connect on
 *  to a listener on the same machine, pass the pseudo-index - as the addr,
 *  socket(-, port).
 *
 *  You call the listener object as a function listener() in order to
 *  wait for a connection request.  When the connection request arrives,
 *  listener() returns a data transfer socket, sock, which will be
 *  connected with the data transfer socket on the requestor's end.
 *  The system puts this socket on a different port from the listener,
 *  which can continue to listen for connections from other processes.
 *  If you don't want to accept any more connections, you can close the
 *  listener immediately after it returns sock.  You can find out the
 *  machine address where the accepted connection originated with
 *  sock.peer.
 *
 *  Once you have a data transfer socket, either from a listener accepting
 *  a connection, or from having requested a conection yourself, the two
 *  ends of the socket are completely symmetric.  You send and receive
 *  data with:
 *    socksend, sock, data;
 *    sockrecv, sock, data;
 *  The data can be any numeric array -- but not strings (use strchar),
 *  strct instances, pointers, or any other datatype.  You must arrange
 *  a protocol so that you know the exact type and number of items
 *  being sent in each message.  Currently, yorick makes no attempt to
 *  switch byte order or make any other allowance for the possibility
 *  that the binary formats might be different between the two ends of
 *  the socket.  Both send and recv block until the requested number
 *  of bytes has been sent or received, raising an error if a
 *  complete transfer does not occur.  If you do not want an error,
 *  you may invoke either socksend or sockrecv as a function, which will
 *  return the number of bytes sent or received, normally sizeof(data),
 *  or -1 on error.  If the other side of the socket closes before
 *  a sockrecv is complete, it may return 0<=nbytes<sizeof(data), but
 *  socksend always returns either -1 or sizeof(nbytes).
 *
 *  The listener() and sock.recv() calls block.  If you want to use them
 *  in an event-driven program which handles other events while waiting,
 *  you can create the listener or sock with a callback, which can be either
 *  a function or a closure, and will be called as noted when input is
 *  ready (or a connection request has been received).  If the callback
 *  function fails to accept the connection or receive the data, it will
 *  immediately be called again -- do not put more than the bare minimum
 *  of code in such a callback; it can easily go into an infinite loop.
 *  Closing the socket is the only way to break out of such a loop.

/*= SECTION(oxy) object oriented extensions to yorick ======================*/

local oxy;
/* DOCUMENT oxy
     Object extension to yorick.  Various yorick packages may create
     "objects", which are collections of data and methods (functions)
     for operating on that data.  Yorick objects are much more free-form
     than other object-oriented languages, in keeping with the fact that
     yorick has no declarative statements.

     Yorick objects have zero or more members; members may be anonymous
     or named.  For objects supporting anonymous members (an optional
     feature), all members whether anonymous or named can be accessed
     by a 1-origin index, as if the members were a 1D array.  Object
     indexing has unusual semantics, similar to the semantics of the
     arguments to the save and restore commands, in which it is the
     name of the variable passed as an argument to the object, rather
     than the value of the variable, which determines which member is
     to be extracted.  For example,
       obj(i)
     refers to the member of obj named "i", whether the value of i is
     1 or 100 or "j" or sqrt(3)+2i or span(0,1,200).  However, by passing
     an expression, rather than a simple variable reference, you can
     make the value of the argument (now that it has no name) be significant.
     Hence, obj("i") is also member "i", while obj(7) is the 7th member,
     obj(3*n+2) is the 3*n+2nd member, and so on.  You can use the noop()
     function to make a variable into an expression, if the member specifier
     happens to be stored in a variable:
       obj(noop(membspec))

     Objects also accept some special arguments:
       obj()   returns the whole object (same as without the parens)
       obj(*)  returns the number of members
       obj(*,) returns an array of member names (string(0) for anonymous)
                 in the index order (if the object supports indexing)
       obj(*,m)  returns an array of the specified member names, or the
                 specified member indices if M is a string array
                 (if the object supports indexing)
       obj(..) returns the attribute object associated with obj, which
                 may be an empty object, or nil [] if obj does not support
                 attributes

     When called as a subroutine, objects accept keyword arguments as a
     shorthand for the save command:
       obj, m1=val1, m2=val2, ...;
     is the same as:
       save, obj, m1=val1, m2=val2, ...;

     Yorick has a generic object, called a "group", which holds an arbitrary
     collection of yorick variables.  You make group objects with the save
     function (see help,save), and you can also use save to add members to
     an existing group object.  Another way to create a group object is by
     passing a membspec argument to any group which specifies multiple
     members -- the result will be a group containing all the specified
     members.  Hence, membspec may be an array of strings, an array of
     indices, or an index range min:max:step, in order to produce a group
     object holding all the specified members.  (Note that dimensionality
     of membspec arrays is lost, and potentially not even number is
     preserved if a single named member is specified multiple times.)

     When you pass more than one argument to an object, the first one
     specifies a single member, and subsequent arguments apply to that
     member.  Thus,
       obj(m, i, j, k)    is similar to     obj(m)(i, j, k)
     In fact, these are exactly the same as long as M does not specify
     a function.  When M is a function, there is a slight difference,
     which is that the function (whether built-in or interpreted) is
     executed in the context of the object obj.  Unlike classic object
     oriented languages, in yorick the use of the context object is not
     automatic -- the function M must specify which object members it
     wishes to access.  You do that with the use function:
       func method(x, y, z) {
         extern var1, var2, var3;
         use, var1, var2, var3;   // initializes vari from context object
         // compute using var1, var2, var3, possibly redefining them
         return result;
         // just before return, any
         // changes to var1, var2, var3 stored back to context object
         // if this function was called by another method by the
         // use_method function, the store back to the context object
         // is deferred until the outermost method returns
       }
     In this form, the arguments to the use call must be external variables
     to the function (method).  If you put the use call(s) at the top of the
     function, you can dispense with the explicit extern statement, provided
     you are careful to check that none of the names matches any of the
     dummy parameter names (x, y, or z here).  [Eventually, the yorick
     parser may treat use specially and enforce this restriction.  For now,
     you need to be sure that any arguments are external to avoid incorrect
     behavior.  Specifically, if any of the vari is local, the external
     variable of that name will be set to nil (or the actual argument value
     if vari is a dummy parameter) when the method returns.  Ouch.]
     Although the vari look like they are extern to the method function,
     use saves their external values and arranges to replace them when the
     function returns, so they behave as if they were local to method.

     Calling use() as a function, or using a special form of restore
     provides a means for direct read-only access to a member.  For example,
     suppose you are going to modify var1 and var3, but merely read var2
     and var4 in the method context:
       func method(x, y, z) {
         use, var1, var3;   // initializes vari from context object
         local var2, var4;  // otherwise, restore arguments would be extern
         restore, use, var2, var4;
         // compute using vari
         var1 = something(var2);   var3 = something(var4);
         return result;
       }
     Or equivalently,
       func method(x, y, z) {
         use, var1, var3;   // initializes vari from context object
         // compute using vari
         var1 = something(use(var2));   var3 = something(use(var4));
         return result;
       }
     As a function, use(arg1, arg2, ...) is exactly the same as
     obj(arg1, arg2, ...), where obj is the context object for the function.
     You have to be careful not to mix this form of read-only access with
     the read-write access of use called as a subroutine: If you have changed
     the value of a variable, use(var) will pick up the unchanged value
     still stored in the context object.

     You can a invoke method function M as a subroutine as well:
       obj, m, i, j, k;
     Inside a method function, you can invoke other methods with the
     use_method function:
       use_method, sibling_method, arg1, arg2;
         or
       x = use_method(sibling_method, arg1, arg2);
     where sibling_method is another method in the same context as the
     caller.  Called as a function, use_method is very nearly the same
     as use; you could write the second line as:
       x = use(sibling_method, arg1, arg2);
     (See help,use for an explanation of the differences.)

     The obj(method,arglist) syntax permits the method argument to be
     an expression whose value is a function.  This allows you to
     invoke functions which are not members of obj in the context of
     obj.  This is useful in two situations: First, you can define
     "friend" functions in C++ parlance, which are not a part of the
     object, but nevertheless understand some part of its structure.
     Second, this is the only way you can call a function in a base
     class which you have shadowed by a virtual function in one of
     its derived classes.  For example, suppose the base_interface
     object contains the method functions f1, f2, f3, etc., and is
     used to derive an object with
       obj = save(,base_interface, data1, data2);
       save, obj, f2;
     where f2 is a different function than the one in base_interface.
     Inside the function f2, you can call the one in base_interface
     like this:
       func f2(a, b) {
         use, data1, data2;
         x = use_method(base_interface(f2), a, b);
         return x + data1 + data2; // or any other expression
       }

     This stripped down facility lets you do most of the things (except
     arguably type checking) other object oriented languages feature,
     although it is a little difficult to see how to do this at first.
     For example, you can think of a "class" as the constructor function
     which makes instances:
       func myclass(data1, data2, ...) {
         // build and return the class, for example:
         return save(method1, method2, ..., data1, data2, ...);
       }
       func method1(x) { return something; }
       func method2(x,y) { return something; }
     You make an instance with:
       mything = myclass(d1, d2);
     Then you can use your object: mything(method2,x,y) and so on.

     This is slightly untidy, because you have to worry about never
     colliding with the method names.  So you could bundle it up neatly
     by making myclass itself an object containing all its methods and
     constructor(s):
       myclass = save(new, method1, method2, ...);  // save old values
       func new(data1, data2, ...) {
         // build and return the class, for example:
         return save(method1, method2, ..., data1, data2, ...);
       }
       func method1(x) { return something; }
       func method2(x,y) { return something; }
       myclass = restore(myclass);   // swap new values into myclass
     (See help,save for examples of this trick.)  Now the only variable
     you have to worry about not clobbering is myclass, and you create
     your object with:
       mything = myclass(new, d1, d2);
     and use it as before.

     There are many ways to handle inheritance (multiple inheritance
     is no harder); the simplest is just to use the save function to
     concatentate new members onto the base class.  [Probably should
     illustrate a good style here...]  The complete absence of type
     checking is actually an advantage here: If an object has a method
     with the required arguments and semantics, it will be usable no
     matter what other members it has.

     You can also extract object members using the dot operator:
       obj.member    is a synonym for    obj("member")
     but note that obj.member(args) may be very different from
     obj(member,args); in general you are better off not using the
     dot operator with objects.  In particular, note that
       obj.member = value;   // ERROR!
     does NOT set the member to value.  (Use obj,member=value;)

         or use_method(memberspec, arg1, arg2, ...)
     Access the context object in an object method function (see help,oxy).

     In the first form, the VARi must be extern to the calling function,
     and you get read-write access to the VARi.  That is, if you redefine
     any of the VARi, your changes will be saved back to the context object
     when the calling function returns.  Even though the VARi are external
     to the method function, use arranges for their external values to be
     replaced when the calling function returns, just as if they had been
     local variables.

     The second form is equivalent to obj(membspec, arg1, arg2, ...),
     where obj is the context object.  You can use this whenever you need
     only read access to membspec.

     The third form permits you to call a method member of the context
     as a subroutine (like "noop,use(memberspec,arg1,arg2,...)").
     The fourth form is similar to the second -- use_method(...) is
     nearly a synonym for use(...), with two exceptions:
     1. use_method(memberspec) invokes the memberspec function with
        zero arguments, while use(memberspec) returns the function
        rather than invoking it.
     2. use_method raises an error if memberspec is not a function,
        while use does not (for example, memberspec could be an array).

     When you invoke a method with use_method (or use as a function),
     any calls to the subroutine form of use (the first form) will
     be cumulative with calls made by the caller.  When a method invoked
     by use_method (or use as a function) returns, the VARi from any
     use subroutine calls it has made are *not* restored when it returns.
     Instead, the restore and the update of the context object itself
     are deferred until the outermost method returns -- the one that
     was not invoked by use_method.

     Therefore, you should generally use the first form for access to
     data members of an object, and the other forms for access to
     function (method) members of objects.  If you violate this rule,
     your method code may have unexpected side effects, unless you can
     guarantee that it your method will never be invoked by another
     method by means of use_method (or use as a function).

     Additionally, you can use the special forms of the save and
     restore function to explicitly save and restore variables from the
     context object:
       restore, use, var1, var2, ...;
       save, use, var1, var2, ...;
     The use function is normally the better choice; the special forms
     of save and restore are for slightly higher performance in unusual
     situations.  If you mix save,use,var or restore,use,var with use,var,
     you will very likely have trouble with different versions of var
     overwriting each other unintentionally.

 */

extern closure;
/* DOCUMENT f = closure(function, data)
         or f = closure(object, member)
     creates a closure function from FUNCTION and DATA.  Invoking the
     closure function invokes FUNCTION with argument DATA prepended
     to the argument list passed to the closure function.  For example,
        f;        is equivalent to    FUNCTION, DATA;
        f(a1,a2)  is equivalent to    FUNCTION(DATA, a1, a2)
     and so on.  When the first argument is an OBJECT, and the second
     argument a MEMBER, the object is invoked with the member as its
     first parameter.  (Typically the member would be a function.)
     If the first argument is an object, then the second argument
     (MEMBER) has the same semantics as object(member, ...): namely,
     if MEMBER is a simple variable reference, its value is ignored,
     and only its name is used to specify which member of the object.
     Hence, if you want the value of MEMBER to be used, you need to
     be sure the second argument to closure is an expression, such
     as noop(member).  If the first argument is a function, then
     the second argument is always a value.

     Finally, the first argument can be a string in order to specify
     that the returned closure object use the value of the named
     variable at runtime for the function (or object).  If you expect
     the value to be an object, prefix the variable name by "o:" in
     order to prevent the closure object from keeping a use of the
     value of the second argument, if MEMBER is a simple variable
     reference.  For example,
       f = closure("myfunc", data);     // keeps use of data value
       g = closure("o:myobj", member);  // ignores value of member
       h = closure("myobj", noop(member));  // o: unnecessary
     This feature is primarily an aid during debugging; typically
     you would remove the quotes (and o:) once the code was working.

     You can query a closure object using the member extraction
     operator:
       f.function  returns function or object
       f.data      returns data or member
       f.function_name  returns name of function or object
       f.data_name      returns name of data
     The names are string(0) if unknown; function_name is known
     if and only if the first argument to closure was a string;
     data_name is known only if the first argument was a string or
     an object and the second argument a simple variable reference.

extern spawn;
/* DOCUMENT process = spawn(argv, on_stdout)
         or process = spawn(argv, on_stdout, on_stderr)
     starts the process named in ARGV(1) with additional arguments
     in any subsequent elements of ARGV (which is a scalar or 1D
     array of strings).  The ON_STDOUT and optional ON_STDERR
     are interpreted functions declared like this:
       func ON_STDOUT(msg)
       {
         commands to process msg on stdout from process
       }

     Yorick will invoke ON_STDOUT asynchronously if process
     emits text to its stdout.  Yorick includes the process in
     the list of event sources, which it polls whenever it waits
     for input.  If the optional ON_STDERR is provided, it is
     called asynchronously whenever process emits a line to stderr;
     with no ON_STDERR, the process will share yorick's stderr,
     which generally means the process stderr prints at the terminal.
     (Note that you can make the third argument the same as the second
     if you want to use the same function to handle stdout and stderr.)
     When the process terminates, ON_STDOUT is invoked with
     string(0) and the process object becomes inactive.  Note that
     ON_STDOUT and ON_STDERR are invoked via the name they were
     originally defined with (in the func or extern statement for
     interpreted and compiled functions, respectively).

     The object returned by spawn, process, can be used to send input
     or signals to the process:
       process, msg;
     where msg is a string, sends msg to the process's stdin.
       process, signum;
     sends process the specified signal (e.g.- signum=2 sends SIGINT,
     like hitting control-C, while signum=9 kills the process), if
     signum is an integer (as opposed to a string).  (Normally you
     should not send signals to a process.)  If you redefine the
     final reference to process, for example by
       process = [];
     yorick will disconnect from the process, closing its end of
     the stdin, stdout, and, optionally, stderr pipes.  For many
     programs, this will stop the program, but if the program can
     continue running without stdin and stdout, it will continue
     running.  (If yorick were a shell, the process would be running
     in the background; if the process would live beyond the shell
     which created it, it will also survive its process variable
     being freed.)

     is very likely (1 chance in 4 billion) to remain unchanged if X is
     corrupted by random noise.  With a non-nil crc0 argument previously
     returned by crc_on, begins with crc0 to yield (roughly speaking) the
     result you would have gotten on a single call if the two X arguments
     had been concatenated (note that the order matters).

     If X is a string array, the strings themselves, not including trailing
     '\0', are concatenated; string(0) is indistinguishable from "".
     If X is a struct instance array or a pointer array, the checksum
     returns an error.  X must be an array or nil [].

     Note that the crc value for any data type other than char depends
     on the native binary format on the platform where crc_on runs; the
     value will be different on other formats, just as it will be different
     for an array cast to a different data type.

     There are many different CRC algorithms, which can be parameterized
     by five integer values:
       CRC_DEF = [width, poly, init, reflect, xor]
     Here width is the width in bits, reflect is either 0 or 1 (false or
     true), and poly, init, and xor are zero except for at most their
     width least significant bits.  The returned crc is also zero except
     for its width least significant bits.  The parameterization is
     described in "A Painless Guide to CRC Error Detection Algorithms" at
       http://www.ross.net/crc/
     (The reflect parameter corresponds to refin and refot, which must
     be equal for crc_on to work, and the xor parameter corresponds to
     xorot.)  You can find a list of popular parameter values at
       http://regregex.bbcmicro.net/crc-catalogue.htm
     Do not try to "roll your own" parameters; let the experts do it.
     Here are some popular choices (crc_on requires width>=8):
       crc_def = [32, 0x04C11DB7, 0xFFFFFFFF, 1, 0xFFFFFFFF]  ("pkzip")
       crc_def = [32, 0x04C11DB7, 0, 0, 0xFFFFFFFF]           ("cksum")
       crc_def = [24, 0x864CFB, 0xB704CE, 0, 0]               ("crc24")
       crc_def = [16, 0x8005, 0, 1, 0]                        ("arc")
       crc_def = [16, 0x1021, 0, 1, 0]                        ("kermit")
     The default is "pkzip".  You can pass any of these five strings
     instead of an array of five numbers as CRC_DEF.
     
     To use a CRC algorithm other than "pkzip", you must first generate
     a CRC_TABLE by calling crc_on(crc_def,-), then pass the CRC_TABLE
     as the second argument with X as the first to compute the CRC.
     Finally, crc_on(crc_table,-) returns the corresponding CRC_DEF;
     crc_on(,-) returns the CRC_DEF for the default "pkzip" algorithm.

            digest = md5(state, data)  return DIGEST from STATE
            sha1 function has same semantics as md5 function
     The md5 and sha1 functions compute message digests or hashes.  The
     digest returned by md5 is an array of 16 char (128 bits); the digest
     returned by sha1 is an array of 20 char (160 bits).  There is a
     single call form, in which the input DATA array comprises the entire
     "message" to be digested.  There is also a multi-call sequence, in
     which you invoke md5 or sha1 with two arguments: The first argument
     is a STATE variable, while the second argument is the DATA to be
     appended to the "message" in that call.  DATA may be nil [], which
     causes no change in the STATE.  STATE must be a simple variable
     reference, which is updated and returned with each call.  As long
     as you call md5 or sha1 as a subroutine, STATE continues to be updated;
     call md5 or sha1 as a function to return the final digest of the
     concatenated "message".  Before the first call, you must initialize
     STATE to [].  The final function call destroys STATE, returning it
     as [].  (To generate the final digest, both the md5 and sha1 algorithms
     append some padding to the input message, which destroys STATE.)

     If DATA is a string array, the strings themselves, not including trailing
     '\0', are concatenated; string(0) is indistinguishable from "".
     If DATA is a struct instance array or a pointer array, the digesting
     function returns an error.  DATA must be an array or nil [].

     Although STATE is an array of char, it is platform dependent even
     though the final digest is not.  Do not attempt to save STATE or
     to use STATE itself as a digest.

     The advantage of md5 or sha1 over the crc_on function is that
     the resulting digest will be unique; no two DATA streams will
     ever produce the same digest for nearly all practical purposes.
     For the 32-bit crc result, you will get different data streams
     that have identical crc values after you process a modest number
     of data streams (tens of thousands).  Thus, md5 or sha1 can be used
     to "fingerprint" data streams; if the fingerprints of two streams
     agree, you can be practically sure the streams themselves agree.

     Both md5 and sha1 have now been "broken" cryptographically, which
     means that it is possible by heroic effort to create two different
     streams with the same digest.  (At this writing, many examples of
     streams with identical md5 digests exist.  No such examples exist
     yet for sha1, but it is clear that a few will appear fairly soon.)
     However, absent malicious intent and huge levels of effort, both
     md5 and sha1 are perfectly useful for fingerprinting data.  These
     algorithms give the same results as the md5sum and sha1sum
     utilities, widely used to fingerprint files on the Web.

 */

extern catch;
/* DOCUMENT catch(category)
     Catch errors of the specified category.  Category may be -1 to
     catch all errors, or a bitwise or of the following bits:

        0x01 math errors (SIGFPE, math library)
        0x02 I/O errors
        0x04 keyboard interrupts (e.g.- control C interrupt)
        0x08 other compiled errors (YError)
        0x10 interpreted errors (error)

     Use catch by placing it in a function before the section of code
     in which you are trying to catch errors.  When catch is called,
     it always returns 0, but it records the virtual machine program
     counter where it was called, and longjumps there if an error is
     detected.  The most recent matching call to catch will catch the
     error.  Returning from the function in which catch was called
     pops that call off the list of catches the interpreter checks.

     To use catch, place the call near the top of a function:

        if (catch(category)) {
          ...<code to execute if error is caught>...
        }
        ...<code "protected" by the catch>...

     If an error with the specified category occurs in the "protected"
     code, the program jumps back to the point of the catch and acts
     as if the catch function had returned 1 (remember that when catch
     is actually called it always returns 0).

     In order to lessen the chances of infinite loops, the catch is
     popped off the active list if it is actually used, so that a
     second error will *not* be caught.  Often, this is only desirable
     for the error handling code itself -- if you want to re-execute
     the "protected" code, do this, and take care of the possibility
     of infinite loops in your interpreted code:

        while (catch(category)) {
          ...<code to execute if error is caught>...
        }
        ...<code "protected" by the catch>...

     After an error has been caught, the associated error message
     (what would have been printed had it not been caught) is left
     in the variable catch_message.

     ***WARNING***
     If the code protected by the catch contains include or require
     calls, or function references which force autoloads, and the
     fault occurs while yorick is interpreting an included file,
     catch will itself fault, and the error code will not execute.
     If a fault occurs after an include has pushed a file onto
     the include stack for delayed parsing and you catch that fault,
     the include stack will not unwind to its condition at the time
     catch was called.  That is, catch is incapable of protecting
     you completely during operations involving nested levels of
     include files.

     In some cases, after_error is a more appropriate way to recover
     from errors.

/* DOCUMENT Debug mode.

   Yorick errors fall into two general categories: Syntax errors discovered
   during parsing, and runtime errors discovered when a Yorick program is
   actually running.  When a runtime error occurs, Yorick offers the
   choice of entering "debug mode", which you can do by typing the <RETURN>
   key immediately after the error occurs.  Typing a non-blank line exits
   debug mode automatically by default.  In debug mode, the Yorick prompt
   becomes "dbug>" instead of the usual ">".  When you see this prompt,
   Yorick has halted "in the middle of" the function in which the error
   occurred, and you can print, plot, modify, or save the local variables
   in that function by means of ordinary Yorick commands.  Debug mode is
   recursive; that is, you can debug an error which occurred during
   debugging to any number of levels.

   You can exit from debug mode in several ways:

      dbexit            -- exit current debug level, discarding all
                           active functions and their local variables
      dbexit, 0         -- exit all debug levels
      dbexit, n         -- exit (at most) N debug levels

      dbcont            -- continue execution of the current function
         Continuing is useful if you have managed to repair the
         problem which caused the error.  The expression in which the
         error occurred will be evaluated a second time, so beware of
         side effects.

      dbret, value      -- continue execution by returning VALUE (which
                           may be nil or omitted) to the caller of the
                           function in which the error occurred.
         This is useful if the function in which the error occurred is
         hopelessly confounded, but you know the value it should return.

   Yorick does not allow "single stepping" directly, although you can
   execute the statements in a function by copying them, then tell
   Yorick to skip those statements you have executed "by hand".  There
   are two functions for skipping execution:

      dbskip            -- skip the next logical line (This will be only
                           a portion of a source line if several statements
                           are stacked on the source line.)
      dbskip, n         -- skip next N (positive or negative) logical lines

      dbup              -- discard the current function, so that you are
                           debugging its caller -- there is no way to go
                           back "down", so be careful

   There are two functions which print information (like other print
   functions, if called as functions instead of subroutines, their
   result is returned as a string array with one line per string):

      dbinfo            -- returns current function and source line

      dbdis             -- returns disassembled virtual machine code
                           for the next line (use the disassemble function
                           to get the entire function)
         This allows you to see exactly where in a line the error occurred.
      dbwhere           -- returns entire calling stack as func[pc] strings
         The dbwhere function also works outside of dbug mode.

   Finally,

      dbauto            -- toggles whether debug mode will be entered
                           automatically when a runtime error occurs
      dbauto, 1         -- enter debug mode automatically after an error
      dbauto, 0         -- type <RETURN> after error to enter debug mode

     implement rudimentary Lisp-like list handling in Yorick.
     However, in Yorick, a list must have a simple tree structure
     - no loops or rings are allowed (loops break Yorick's memory
     manager - beware).  You need to be careful not to do this as
     the error will not be detected.

     Lists are required in Yorick whenever you need to hold an
     indeterminate amount of non-array data, such as file handles,
     bookmarks, functions, index ranges, etc.  Note that Yorick
     pointers cannot point to these objects.  For array data, you have
     a choice between a list and a struct or an array of pointers.
     Note that a list cannot be written into a file with the save
     function, since it may contain unsaveable items.

     The _lst (list), _cat (catenate), and _cpy (copy) functions
     are the principal means for creating and maintaining lists.
     _lst makes a list out of its arguments, so that each argument
     becomes one item of the new list.  Unlike Yorick array data
     types, a statement like x=list does not make a copy of the
     list, it merely makes an additional reference to the list.
     You must explicitly use the _cpy function to copy a list.  Note
     that _cpy only copies the outermost list itself, not the items
     in the list (even if those items are lists).  With the second
     argument i, _cpy copies only the first i items in the list.
     The _cat function concatentates several lists together,
     "promoting" any arguments which are not lists.  This operation
     changes the values of list arguments to _cat, except for the
     final argument, since after _cat(list, item), the variable list
     will point to the new longer list returned by _cat.

     Nil, or [], functions as an empty list.  This leads to ambiguity
     in the argument list for _cat, since _cat "promotes" non-list
     arguments to lists; _cat treats [] as an empty list, not as a
     non-list item.  Also, _lst() or _lst([]) returns a single item list,
     not [] itself.

     The _len function returns the number of items in a list, or 0
     for [].

     The _car and _cdr functions (the names are taken from Lisp,
     where they originally stood for something like "address register"
     and "data register" of some long forgotten machine) provide
     access to the items stored in a list.  _car(list,i) returns the
     i-th item of the list, and i defaults to 1, so _car(list) is the
     first item.  Also, _car,list,i,new_item_i sets the i-th item
     of the list.  Finally, _cdr(list,i) returns a list of all the
     items beyond the i-th, where i again defaults to 1.  The form
     _cdr,list,i,new_list_i can be used to reset all list items
     beyond the i-th to new values.  In the _cdr function, i=0 is
     allowed.  When used to set values, both _car and _cdr can also
     be called as functions, in which case they return the item or
     list which has been replaced.  The _cdr(list) function returns
     nil if and only if LIST contains only a single item; this is
     the usual means of halting a loop over items in a list.
