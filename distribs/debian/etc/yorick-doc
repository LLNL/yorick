# This file configures the behavior of the update-yorickdoc command
# from the yorick-doc package.
# It is sourced by update-yorickdoc, which is a standard shell script.

# Should automatic updates ever happen?
# Yorick add-ons call update-yorickdoc with the --auto flag whenever they 
# are installed or uninstalled. This is a no-op if the following is set to 0.

#ENABLE_AUTO=1

# Default directory for update-yorickdoc files (*.packinfo,
# *.keywords, and *.aliases). Also adjust the location of the template
# file if you change that. Note that this option only controls
# where update-yorickdoc looks for these files, packages will always
# drop their files in the default location.

#SRC_DIR=/usr/share/yorick-doc
#TEMPLATE=${SRC_DIR}/template.html

# The following variables are defaults for the command line options.
# FROM:     a semicolon-separated list of directories to scan for yorick
#           include files.
# TO:       the top-level folder of the documentation tree.
# XREF_DIR: the subdirectory of $TO where to put the files we will
#           construct. Warning: the content of this directory wll be first 
#           erased, don't use a directory which contains something you value.
