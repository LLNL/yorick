DescDetail: <<
Yorick is an interpreted programming language, designed for
postprocessing or steering large scientific simulation codes. Smaller
scientific simulations or calculations, can be written as standalone
yorick programs. The language features a compact syntax for many
common array operations, so it processes large arrays of numbers very
efficiently. Unlike most interpreters, which are several hundred times
slower than compiled code for number crunching, yorick can approach to
within a factor of four or five of compiled speed for many common
tasks. Superficially, yorick code resembles C code, but yorick
variables are never explicitly declared and have a dynamic scoping
similar to many Lisp dialects. The yorick language is designed to be
typed interactively at a keyboard, as well as stored in files for
later use. Yorick includes an interactive graphics package, and a
binary file package capable of translating to and from the raw numeric
formats of all modern computers.

DescUsage: <<
See /sw/share/yorick/1.6/i/testfull.i for a test suite. Type 
"yorick -batch testfull.i" in a xterm to run it.
<<
DescPort: <<
This package will compile Yorick only on MacOSX 10.3.4 or later, because
of a bug in the system math library libm (part of /usr/lib/LibSystem.dylib)
in earlier versions of MacOSX 10.3.
