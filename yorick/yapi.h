The argc arguments are on the interpreter stack.  When you return
from my_builtin, the top of the stack becomes the return value of your
function.  This API refers to elements on the stack by an index iarg;
iarg=0 means the top of the stack, iarg=1 is the second stack element,
iarg=2 is the third, and so on down to iarg=argc-1.  (The my_builtin
function itself is normally at iarg=argc when the interpreter calls
the function.)  On entry to my_builtin, its arguments are in reverse
order on the stack (in other words, the interpreter has pushed them
onto the stack in order), so that iarg=argc-1 is the first argument,
and iarg=0 is the last argument.  However, if your function accepts
keywords, the keywords will be randomly interspersed with the
positional arguments, and you must use the yarg_kw function in order
to parse the argument list.

To use yarg_kw, declare knames and kglobs as static arrays:
  static char *knames[NKEYS+1] = { "keyname1", "keyname2", ..., 0 };
  static long kglobs[NKEYS+1];
The kiargs array is an automatic (local) array
  int kiargs[NKEYS];
You must call yarg_kw_init before the first call to yarg_kw.  If
kglobs[0]=0 (as it will be with the above static definition), then
yarg_kw_init initializes it to [NKEYS, index1, index2, ...], where
indexN is the global symbol table index corresponding to the variable
named "keynameN".  If kglobs[0] != 0, yarg_kw_init ignores knames.
The yarg_kw_init function always initializes all kiargs[i] to -1.
Beginning with iarg=argc-1, you call
  iarg = yarg_kw(iarg, kglobs, kiargs);
If the return iarg>=0, it represents the first positional argument;
process it, then decrement iarg and call yarg_kw again, repeating this
process until iarg<0.  At this point you have processed all the
positional arguments, and yarg_kw has stored the iarg value for any
keyword arguments in the kiargs array.  That is, kiargs[i] will be the
iarg corresponding to keyword knames[i], or -1 if that keyword was not
present.

An alternative more primitive function yarg_key simply returns the
index of a keyword in the global symbol table, or -1 if iarg is
positional.  If the return value is not -1, then iarg-1 is the
corresponding key value, and you can continue parsing the argument
list with iarg-2.

test is the same as the interpreted is_void, rank returns -1 if not an

returns 0 if iarg is not a string, 1 if it is a scalar string, 2 if it
is a string array.  The func test is the same as is_func.  The typeid
returns the typeid as listed above, or some other value for internal

destroyed when this stack element is dropped (such an array can be

Dimension lists in this API have the same format as the interpreted
dimsof function, that is, [rank, len1, len2, ...], where rank is the
number of dimensions (zero for a scalar), and lenN is the length of
the Nth dimension, with len1 incrementing fastest in memory, len2 next
fastest, and so on.  Functions returning dims expect it to be
declared like this:
    long dims[Y_DIMSIZE];
Functions which accept dims as input, on the other hand, can accept
a dims array shorter than Y_DIMSIZE, if their rank is lower than the
maximum.

Next are a set of routines for retrieving usable data from the stack.
The ygets functions return scalar values, while ygeta functions return
array values.  The ygeta functions have two output arguments: If ntot
is non-zero, *ntot is set to the total number of array elements, and
if dims is non-zero, dims[0] is set to rank and dims[1:rank] are set
to the dimension lengths.  As noted above, dims should be dimensioned
using Y_DIMSIZE (although by checking yarg_rank first, you could
safely use a smaller dims).  Except as noted, all the yget functions
perform type conversions as necessary to force the argument to the
requested data type.  The sole exceptions are ygets_l and ygets_d,
which will not demote the type, although they will promote it.  In all
cases, if iarg cannot be convrted to the requested type, or if it is
not a scalar in a ygets, YError will be called and the function will
never return.  If you care, you need to use the query functions first.

if cfmdims was specified.  Note that cfmdims is both an input and
an output to yarg_dims (unlike yarg_conform, where it is an output).

 The yarg_conform routine checks array conformability.  The return
argument of yarg_conform is the cfmdims dimension list of the result
of a binary operation on arrays of dims1 and dims2- its return value
is -1 if dims1 and dims2 are not conformable, or the union of zero to
three of the flags Y_1_BCAST, Y_2_BCAST, Y_1_EXTEND, or Y_2_EXTEND.
If the Y_1_BCAST flags is set, it means that one or more of the dims1
dimensions has length 1 and the corresponding dims2 dimension has
length>1.  The Y_1_EXTEND flag means that the rank of dims1 is lower
than the rank of dims2; ordinarily, this also means that the Y_1_BCAST
flag will be set, but if all the trailing dimensions of dims2 have
length 1, Y_1_EXTEND could be set while Y_1_BCAST was not.  The
cfmdims array can be the same as dims1 or dims2, in which case the
original dimension list is overwritten.  If cfmdims=0, the check is
performed without returning the result dimension list.  In the case

The yarg_bcast routine broadcasts an array to a larger size. The
return value of yarg_bcast is 0 if the broadcast is possible, non-zero
on a conformability error.  (The case that dims1 or dims2 requires no
broadcast, but has lower rank than the result is a no-op.)

to an index, while yfind_global returns the index corresponding to a

Six API functions manipulate lists:

You should statically initialize the uo_type structure (with
uo_ops=0).  For function-like objects, the uo_ops member must then be
initialized in a special way by calling yfunc_obj; otherwise, the
uo_ops member will be initialized on the first call to ypush_obj.
Before applying yfunc_obj or before the first call to ypush_obj, make
sure uo_ops=0, and do not touch it afterwards.  The virtual functions
for your object can be 0 to get default behavior.  Like ypush_scratch,
the on_free, if present, should not attempt to free the object itself,
just its contents.  If no special action is required to free your
object, use on_free=0.  If on_print=0, printing the object will print
a generic phrase including its type_name.  The on_eval is invoked like
a builtin function:
  object(arg1, arg2, ...)
in the interpreted code will invoke
  on_eval(object, argc)
with the argc arguments on the stack; you should leave the result on
the top of the stack, and treat this like any other my_builtin.  The
member on_extract is called as a result of interpreted code
  object.member_name
producing the compiled call
  on_extract(object, member_name)
Again, you should leave the result on the top of the stack.  If
on_eval or on_extract is zero, that operation will cause a runtime
error (the default behavior).  Note that you can use the yarg_kw_init
function (with kiargs=0) to retrieve name indices.

An object created by ypush_obj can be retrieved by yget_obj.  Passing
uo_type=0 to yget_obj returns the type_name for the object at iarg;
otherwise it returns the pointer to the object itself, as created by
ypush_obj.  For example,
y_userobj_t examp1_ops = { "example1 user object",
  &examp1_free, &examp1_print, &examp1_eval, &examp1_extract, 0 };
y_userobj_t examp2_ops = { "example2 user object",
  &examp2_free, &examp2_print, &examp2_eval, &examp2_extract, 0 };
A function which expects an example1 object at iarg=0 would simply
call yget_obj(iarg, &examp1_ops).  However, if either an example1 or
an example2 object were an acceptable iarg=0 argument, you would call
name=yget_obj(iarg,0), then check whether name==examp1_ops.type_name or
name==examp2_ops.type_name.  Note that the string itself is irrelevant --
checking the string value is not only a waste of time, but also there is no
guarantee the value is unique.  Instead, you want to check that the
address examp1_ops.type_name (or examp2_ops.type_name) is returned.  Note
that you can easily write your own yarg_examp1(iarg) or yarg_examp2(iarg)
function that retrieves specific object types with whatever semantics
you like if the actual argument is not the correct type.  Similarly, you
can write ypush_examp1 or ypush_examp2, with whatever constructor arguments
make sense.

The y_print function must be used by the on_print callback to produce
output.  Do not attempt to use y_print except in a on_print callback.
Set newline to 1 to force a newline after text; your message will
always start on a newline, and a newline will be forced after the
final text you emit (whether or not your final call to y_print sets
newline).

Yorick memory management works by reference counting.  Your compiled
code may need to own a use of a yorick object, for example, when one
user object type contains a pointer to another and both are visible
to interpreted code.  The yget_use function obtains a private use of
an object on the stack.  You can obtain a use of a yorick user defined
persistent object or array (but not a double, long, or int scalar)
by calling yget_use.  The returned handle is opaque -- you must save it
and call ypush_use to push the object back onto the stack and give up
your use.  After calling ypush_use, you must zero all your copies of
the opaque handle.  You can use the ygeta_* or yget_obj functions to
get the pointers to the actual data.  As a side effect, yget_use converts
a scalar double, long, or int stack element into a rank 0 array, since
you cannot own a use of the scalars.  This invalidates any existing pointer
you may have retrieved using ygeta_*, so call yget_use first.  The
ykeep_use function is like ypush_use, except you do not give up your
use of the object; ydrop_use discards your use (like ypush_use) without
pushing the object onto the stack.
